      <p>&quot;Salaam, 
        sahib!&quot; <br>
        &quot;Hullo there, pal.&quot; <br>
        &quot;Baksheesh?&quot; <br>
        &quot;Bugger off!&quot; </p>
      <p>Pete brushed 
        the ragged little Indian shepherd boy aside and stomped on up the valley. 
        The gaggle of children quickly gave him up as a bad job and turned their 
        beady-eyed gaze to me, toiling up the slope a hundred yards behind. They 
        tripped gaily down the hill and planted themselves in front of me. Surely 
        this one would give them a rupee? With bright eyes and sheepish grins 
        they stretched out thin arms, imploring a coin, a pen, a cigarette. </p>
      <p>I solemnly 
        explained that where I came from, Scotland, nobody ever gave baksheesh 
        away. Their painful attempts to look doe-eyed came to nothing and I trudged 
        on past the screeching crowd. They glared furiously at my enormous rucksack, 
        no doubt crammed to the very brim with wads of crisp rupees. They became 
        unbearably persistant, running past to block our way time and time again. 
        Why should Allah bless these soft white Europeans, who had obviously never 
        done a days work in their lives, with as much money as they wanted, while 
        they had to scrape a precarious living on these high Himalayan slopes 
        from their sheep and goats? How could it he fair? </p>
      <p>This was 
        the Thajuras Valley, near Srinagar in Kashimir, inhabited by the Gujar 
        people. Further east an enormous change occurs in landscape and people. 
        One could be entering a different world as one crosses the Zoji La Pass. 
        The lush greenery of Kashmir, watered annually by the life-giving monsoon, 
        gives out and is replaced by a rocky wasteland. Dry and barren hills of 
        rock stretch up to a fierce blue sky - cloudless and withering. The rock 
        is sand coloured but tinted by a range of impurities that give it an unbelievable 
        range of colours. The land is cracked like the palm of a hand by the muddy 
        glacial rivers carrying their loads down to the sea by contorted routes. 
        </p>
      <p>This is 
        Ladakh, ’Little Tibet’, and the change in landscape is accompanied by 
        an equally profound contrast in the people. Kashmir is populated by Moslem 
        Indians, people whose years of isolation in the Vale of Kashmir has given 
        them a quite disproportionate love of money. The Ladakhis, however, are 
        Mongoloid and more closely allied to their Tibetan neighbours. Their character 
        is cheerful and friendly – the children are shy but quick to smile. The 
        aged have faces seamed and creased by years of exposure to the dry climate. 
        Tourism has not yet stretched its grasping hand over the country, although 
        the process has started in the capital, Leh. The religion here is probably 
        an important factor in the more easy-going attitude to life. Ladakh is 
        Buddhist – littered with isolated monasteries tended by red-robed monks 
        devoting their lives to study and worship. Buddhism is a gentle religion, 
        advocating improvement through the mind, not like the material aggressiveness 
        of Islam. </p>
      <p>Further 
        south is Zanskar, much the same as Ladakh but with its own language and 
        costume. Even less exploited, especially if you escape from the main north-south 
        trekking routes, it is an inspiring place. There are villages every few 
        miles on the big rivers: clusters of sandy flat-roofed houses, surrounded 
        by a patchwork of fields irrigated ingeniously from side valley springs. 
        The main crop is barley, from which is made flour or tsampa. The tsampa 
        is usually added to butter tea to make a nourishing if. uninspiring meal. 
        The mixture when redried looks very like sand but tastes like doughy wholemeal 
        bread. </p>
      <p>We trekked 
        down through this country, often stopping at villages and asking if we 
        could have a roof. for the night. Communication was always smiles and 
        hand-signals, which made it impossible to fix prices until it was too 
        late, but we were never over-charged. Occasionally after dinner some chang 
        would be found – a potent barley beer that tastes very innocuous. </p>
      <p>Still further 
        south, on the Indian side of the Himalayan range, our ethnic tour of Kashmir 
        and Ladakh ended at the fascinating village of Manali in Himachel Pradesh. 
        In a high valley away from the humid North Indian plains, perched amid 
        its acres of apple trees, Manali is a cool, relaxed haven. Living is cheap, 
        dope is plentiful. Manali is a veritable melange of cultures; Buddhists, 
        Moslems, Hindus and a lot of well established Europeans mix in a melee 
        of clothes and colours. There is a large Tibetan contingent led by the 
        exiled Dalai Lama – the living god of Buddhism – who lives nearby. The 
        town with its markets and restaurants, Indian and Chinese, is friendly 
        and cheerful: a luscious tonic after a strenuous holiday.<br>
