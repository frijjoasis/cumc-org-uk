        <b>CLASSIC ROUTES OF OUR TIME � NO. 17</b></P>

      <p>One of the 
        finest routes in the area, this classic climb has been a mountaineer�s 
        testpiece since the days of Winthrop-Young. It�s difficulties should not 
        be underestimated and an Alpine start is essential because of vigorous 
        activity associated with the area in the mornings. The walk-in is not 
        arduous � a mere 15 minutes from the road � the western approach being 
        least fraught by objective danger. Start in the SE corner of the gloomy 
        northern corrie. </p>
      <p>1) Climb 
        steep rock to a ledge on the right. </p>
      <p>2) Traverse 
        in to the base of the wall and follow the obvious drainage line. </p>
      <p>3) Move 
        easily right along the wide ledge to a cave belay beneath a pinnacle. 
        </p>
      <p>4) Climb 
        to roof of cave, and up to the pinnacle. </p>
      <p>5) Traverse 
        north &agrave; cheval along an exciting ridge, particularly exposed to 
        objective dangers. From the end climb up to a ledge and work rightwards 
        to a short chimney. </p>
      <p>6) Tricky 
        bridging gains a good edge on the left. Layback up the slab to the crest 
        of the ridge, being wary of. creaking flakes. </p>
      <p>7) Crux. 
        Follow the drainage channel to a difficult mantelshelf, then up the chimney 
        past rattling chockstones. From the niche at the top make a very exposed 
        step right to the base of a V-groove (good runners). Thin climbing up 
        a pillar leads to a final airy move and good holds beneath the top (care 
        with rock). Belay well back. </p>
      <p>Purists 
        will include an ascent of one of the pinnacles above the summit plateau, 
        although this should not be contemplated during an electrical storm.</p>
