        <b>CIC – CUMC</b></P>
      <div align="center">
        <p>Kate Phillips 
          and Roger Austin</p>
      </div>
      
      <p>So this 
        was it, that infamous scene of many an epic fester the Charles Inglis 
        Clark Hut on the slopes of Ben Nevis. Described by various CUMC members, 
        and even hardened mountaineers, as &quot;a squalid little hole&quot;, 
        it was a welcoming sight nonetheless after toiling up the Allt A’Mhuillin 
        for two hours, laden down with vast supplies of consumables and even a 
        little ice-climbing gear. I had been assured that the latter would he 
        totally redundant and indeed, much equipment had already been abandoned 
        in lockers at Port William station as the prospect of the walk-in had 
        been faced. The secret behind the popularity of the annual CUMC meet at 
        the CIC Hut was, it had seemed to me, the guarantee of foul weather on 
        the Ben rendering all forms of outdoor activity impossible... so it seemed 
        somewhat foolish to come too well prepared. </p>
      <p>All the 
        previous week, talk had been of nothing but food to be taken; meals, snacks 
        and little things to nibble whilst idling away five days in the hut. Being 
        but a novice in the art of festering (as well as ice-climbing), I had 
        chosen as my &quot;climbing&quot; partner one of the CUMC’s most accomplished 
        members in this field. The fact. that Roger had done very little ice-climbing 
        himself seemed completely irrelevant! </p>
      <p>Roger, Robert 
        and Pete, and I had come up a day early to ensure that first thing Sunday 
        morning we could grab the bunks nearest the stoves, so as to minimise 
        movement once established indoors. Saturday night, as we packed into Robert’s 
        new tent (a self-collapsing Phoenix model of ingenious design), I thought 
        blissfully of the relaxing few days that I believed lay ahead. </p>
      <p>You may 
        imagine my feelings early the next morning when driven from my warm sleeping 
        bag by others with less cosy pits, to discover that it was, in fact, a 
        beautiful day, and I was expected to go out and get some fresh air, God 
        forbid! </p>
      <p align="CENTER">***</p>
      <p>Tower Ridge 
        was a hoot. Up and out in the pearly dawn, bitching at the cold and exclaiming 
        at the day. Then away up the hill – playing hide-and-seek behind the boulders, 
        meeting nature in the raw – while we gained a sort of momentum which carried 
        us up into the Douglas Gap, where Robert and Pete waited. </p>
      <p>After the 
        first groove, which was steep and awkward, we moved together on easy ground, 
        following Robert and Pete along icy shelves and around jutting outcrops 
        of rock. We got bored of that after a bit, so while Pete went footling 
        off around the corner, I went straight up the hard-looking bit in the 
        middle. Only it was easy really and I popped out below the Great Tower, 
        sunlight and snow banked on the rock before me, and unhappy voices drifting 
        up from the right. The Eastern Traverse was easy too, but Tower Gap gave 
        pause for thought until my hand closed over the big spike. Kate messed 
        up the rope there, and found herself fishing in Glover’s Chimney with 
        fifty feet of best nylon line. After that it was all over bar the shouting 
        and the man at the top who kept taking pictures. </p>
      <p>It was lunchtime 
        on the summit, so we gorged ourselves on a delicious panorama of peaks 
        and lochs, from Ben Macdhui to the Cuillin of Skye, ebony on aching blue. 
        For dessert we peered down Zero, then trudged off towards Coire Leis and 
        the Little Brenva Face. Kate’s ankles hurt, her enthusiasm tempered, her 
        eyes fixed on the hut. </p>
      <p>&quot;Do 
        you want to do Cresta?&quot; <br>
        &quot;Not really.&quot; <br>
        &quot;O.K. We’ll do Bob Run.&quot; </p>
      <p align="CENTER">***</p>
      <p>Front-pointing 
        came as a considerable relief for my tortured ankles, unused to the vice-like 
        grip of Nark’s &quot;big boots&quot;. Robert moved across from a dripping 
        Cresta to join Roger on the first pitch of Bob Bun. They spent some time 
        showering me with fragments of ice whilst placing, on a trivial section 
        of ice, the most solid drive-in I was to see all week. When the time came 
        for me to remove it, instead of lifting straight out in the usual manner 
        of ice-pro, it stubbornly resisted all my attempts to loosen it, and I 
        had to resort to excavating a large section of the route with rather uncontrolled 
        swings of my axe. </p>
      <p>On reaching 
        the top, I declined the offer of a quick stroll up Carn M&ocirc;r Dearg 
        with R &amp; R and hobbled down towards the hut to join Pete for a brew. 
        A helicopter was lifting off some unfortunate who had taken a 100 yard 
        slide down the rocks next to the abseil posts, but my spirits, raised 
        high by the thought of steaming mugs of tea, platefuls of tasty tomato 
        pasta and cheesy-toasties, could not be dampened. </p>
      <p>The scene 
        in the hut that evening was less sordid than I had been led to expect. 
        Where were the semi-naked bodies, bathed in sweat and condensation from 
        the sauna-like atmosphere; the poker dice, cards and whisky bottles? The 
        only alcohol on the entire mountain was a bottle of the amber fluid which 
        Roger and I had brought, and we were determined that that would go no 
        further than our corner of the bunk. I ascribed the almost civilised ambience 
        to the fact that Rob Barton had yet to arrive, but had high hopes of the 
        next day. </p>
      <p>Monday dawned 
        bright and clear, much to my horror, and once again I was labouring up 
        the slopes from the hut, cursing at the pain being inflicted on my ankles. 
        Much of the morning was spent in a &quot;serious attempt&quot; on Point 
        Five – me slowly disappearing beneath a growing heap of snow on the belay, 
        whilst Roger cursed the elements somewhere out of sight above my head. 
        Time and again he was driven back from near the top of the second pitch 
        by facefuls of freezing spindrift, as below, the figures of Robert and 
        Pete, who had arrived to spectate, faded in and out of view behind a curtain 
        of white. Finally, after some hours and considerable pressure from his 
        frozen second, Roger came down and we quickly knocked off Tower Scoop 
        before returning to the hut for a well-deserved mid-afternoon tea. </p>
      <p align="CENTER">***</p>
      <p>Robert leaned 
        over the table. </p>
      <p>&quot;What’s 
        that?&quot; <br>
        &quot;Dahl.&quot; <br>
        &quot;And that?&quot; <br>
        &quot;Mushroom biriyani.&quot; <br>
        &quot;Oh.&quot; </p>
      <p>I continued 
        feeding my face, and the enormous mound of food on my plate slowly diminished. 
        </p>
      <p>&quot;Can 
        I try some?&quot; <br>
        &quot;Sure. Finish it, I’m full.&quot; </p>
      <p>I watched 
        in fascination as Robert shovelled down half a plateful of mixed veg and 
        spices, to join the amalgam of Beanfeast, beef stew and cheesy-toasties 
        already lining his gut. He grunted, belched. </p>
      <p>&quot;It’s 
        alright, I suppose.&quot; </p>
      <p>I lay back, 
        replete, whilst the conversation ebbed and flowed around me. </p>
      <p>&quot;Another 
        brew, youth?&quot; <br>
        &quot;... crapping myself.&quot; A Barton epic. <br>
        &quot;I see England won.&quot; <br>
        &quot;South Gully ... grade IV ... 10’ cornice.&quot; A Rushman epic. 
        <br>
        &quot;Where’s my handbag?&quot; <br>
        &quot;... anal sex ...&quot; Barton again. <br>
        &quot;Zero was pretty thin.&quot; A Herold failure. <br>
        &quot;Robert, your toast’s burning.&quot; <br>
        &quot;I think I’ve got frostbite.&quot; A Wilson epic. <br>
        &quot;Put on a brew, Brendan!&quot; </p>
      <p>The long, 
        hot evening wore slowly an. Next morning I waited at the entrance to the 
        Gorge as Kate advanced from the hut with all the speed and grace of an 
        arthritic tortoise, displaying a vocabulary catholic in variety if not 
        sentiment. We geared-up there, and I soloed off up the icy sidewall, staying 
        solicitously close ahead of Kate until an attempted axe placement behind 
        my Achilles tendon persuaded me to keep my distance. </p>
      <p>When we 
        arrived at Garadh, the frostbite team were already ensconced on the second 
        pitch. The route consisted of straightforward ice, followed by a long 
        n&eacute;v&eacute; slope broken by a ten foot ice step. We elected to 
        dispense with the rope and caught Brendan below the step. He and I looked 
        on in amusement as Kate flailed up, one axe over the top, one crampon 
        scarting on the bulge below, space limbs thrashing wildly. I followed 
        in similar style. </p>
      <p>Then we 
        did Raeburn’s Easy Route, sort of by accident. Comb was occupied and I 
        didn’t like the look of where I thought Raeburn’s went, so we soloed some 
        ice bulges. Only that was really Raeburn’s, and there was nothing left 
        to do but crab across acres of steep, hard n&eacute;v&eacute;, calves 
        screaming despite platforms hacked every fifty feet. At a patch of unexpectedly 
        soft snow Kate decided that she was tired of sideways movement and departed 
        rapidly downwards on her stomach. The random swing of an axe stopped her 
        before she became fully committed to a free-fall reversal of No. 2 Gully 
        Buttress. We moved on and, after a brief struggle with the cornice, emerged 
        onto the windswept plateau. </p>
      <p>I suggested 
        Comb Gully to round off the day. Kate calmly replied that she had to wash 
        her hair. Stunned by the enormity of this concept, I wandered back down 
        to the hut in a daze. </p>
      <p align="CENTER">***</p>
      <p>The attention 
        paid to my hair-washing session was, I thought, quite excessive. I was 
        virtually ostracised the entire evening for being ’clean’ – a state obviously 
        alien to other (male!) occupants of the hut. By now I was resigned to 
        the fact that the more sordid aspects of life in the hut were unlikely 
        to manifest themselves whilst I was present, so I opened the whisky bottle, 
        which had been carefully stashed on my corner of the bunk, and attempted 
        to get Brendan drunk. </p>
      <p>Wednesday 
        was .html fine day, but someone muttered something about it being windy, 
        so I stayed in my pit until driven out by too many brews. It was to be 
        my last day on the Ben and I was determined to make it a lazy one. I cast 
        around for some excuse to stay indoors. </p>
      <p>Apart from 
        my hair-washing session I had managed to avoid all contact with the grease-encrusted 
        sink, but now every surface in the hut was piled high with filthy dishes 
        and pans and by midday I could stand it no longer. I shrugged off my cloak 
        of apathy and commenced battle with dishcloth in hand. Within hours patches 
        of table could be discerned through the grot and there were enough clean 
        mugs for Roger, Jeremy and I to have .html brew, so I laid down my cloth 
        and turned my attention to food. We pooled our resources; porridge oats, 
        sugar, Jeremy’s butter . . . then my gaze fell upon Jon’s enormous jar 
        of golden syrup. </p>
      <p>&quot;Flapjacks!&quot; 
        </p>
      <p>Several 
        hours later, stomachs groaning after the self- indulgent feast, Roger, 
        Jeremy and I strolled up Observatory Gully to watch with interest as some 
        crazed Frenchmen struggled against the spindrift on Point Five. It was 
        with considerable satisfaction I later learned that the trio had retreated 
        before completing the first pitch. </p>
      <p>The following 
        morning, as I stumbled down towards Fort William in the first light of 
        dawn, my thoughts turned to Arran, the geology field trip and prospect 
        of snatching a few routes on spare afternoons. But what thrills could 
        a mere rock route hold after the excitement of steep ice? </p>
      <p align="CENTER">***</p>
      <p>Robert and 
        Pete arose as Kate and the frostbite team departed, and sloped off muttering 
        something about &quot;having .html look at Zero.&quot; It required no 
        act of clairvoyance to see that the wind lashing the hut would he channeling 
        rivers of spindrift down Point Five, so Rob and I remained in our pits 
        whilst breakfast noises rose slowly to a crescendo and faded with janglings 
        of ice gear and the creak of the outer door. </p>
      <p>In the wee 
        sma’ hours of the afternoon we left the hut and trolled up Coire na Ciste, 
        buffeted by erratic gusts from a cerulean sky. By an artful strategem 
        I arrived first at the foot of Green Gully and disappeared upwards, pretending 
        to have spotted a belay stance. As I reached the third pitch, a plaintive 
        cry floated up. </p>
      <p>&quot;I’d 
        really rather not solo this route!&quot; </p>
      <p>This was 
        Rob ’Psycho’ Barton? Joining me at the newly fashioned stance, he confessed 
        sheepishly that he &quot;wasn’t properly psyched up.&quot; In more conventional 
        style we climbed gloriously easy ice to a plateau scoured by the wind 
        to a polycrystalline expanse of firm n&eacute;v&eacute;. I jumped up and 
        down with joy and cold toes, then we scampered off down No. 4 and returned 
        to the hut to feast on the last of the three day old minestrone. </p>
      <p>With Kate 
        gone, the climate of the hut reverted to normal and the atmosphere once 
        again became blue with contributions, verbal and anal, from the assembled 
        company. From my perch on the upper bunk, I looked out past tousled heads 
        and piles of dirty dishes to the pool of stagnant water growing beneath 
        the sink, the toast burning under the grill and the socks steaming by 
        the fire. But my mind raced on towards Arran, beguiled my visions of remote 
        island fastnesses, soaring towers of golden granite and .html tick in 
        Hard Rock. </p>
      <p>But fate 
        was to play a different card. Three days later I stood shivering on a 
        ledge 400 feet up the Rosa Pinnacle whilst the only snowfall of the holiday 
        swirled around me and the mists closed in. As the others prepared to abseil 
        off, my thoughts returned to the CIC: claustrophobic warmth, cheesy-toasties, 
        and the satisfaction of knowing that the gale could do its worst. It was 
        to be a long, cold retreat.<br>
        </p>
