<H3>No. 32: Welsh Cakes </H3>

<P>Following the success of Rob’s &quot;vitamin free, calorie-and-cholesterol-packed, very tasty and totally scrumptious hyper–space filling Trangia pizza&quot; (Cambridge Mountaineering 1983), here is a recipe for Welsh Cakes a la Trangia – just the thing to turn a wet campsite in the Lakes into a gourmets paradise. One word of caution though; make sure the campsite is deserted before you commence as the delicious smell is enough to attract fellow campers to your tent like climbers to cafes. </P>

<B><P>Ingredients </P>
</B>
<P>8 oz plain flour </P>

<P>2 tbs sugar </P>

<P>4 oz butter or margarine </P>

<P>2-3 oz sultanas </P>

<P>2 tsps baking powder </P>

<P>a little nutmeg (optional) </P>

<P>lots of cinnamon </P>

<P>1 egg &amp; a little milk </P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Invite Rob to join you for the weekend – his pizzas are superb and his presence has the added bonus of ensuring that nothing more active than a stroll to the shops is undertaken. </P>

<P>Mix flour, b.p., spices and sugar in a large billy and tub in fat (best done outside or in someone else’s tent, as it can get rather messy!) </P>

<P>Add sultanas, then mix in egg and as much milk as necessary to make a firm dough. Form into small balls and flatten into discs about 1/4 in. thick. </P>

<P>Fry in lightly greased lid with simmer ring on, worrying them continuously until well browned on both sides (5-10 minutes). Alternatively, fry on full flame for only a minute or so. </P>

<P>Eat before they get cold (obv) </P>
