        <b>CHERRY 
        HINTON CHALK PIT &#150; AN INTERIM GUIDE</b><br>
        <br>
        Peter Clegg</P>
      
      <b><br>
      OS ref. TL 555483</b>  
      <p><b>Situation 
        and approaches</b> </p>
      <p>The chalk 
        pit is on the western edge of the Gog-Magog Hills, about two miles south-east 
        of Cambridge city centre. From 
        the centre, go up Hills Rd. then left along the Cherry Hinton Rd. for 
        about a mile and a half, past Cherry Hinton Hall. At the traffic lights 
        turn right, then first left. The entrance will be seen almost immediately 
        on the left. </p>
      <p><b>Access</b> 
        </p>
      <p>The pit 
        appears to be owned by Cambridge Chalk and Cement Co. Ltd., who have gone 
        to vast expense by fencing the place off and erecting &quot;Keep Out&quot; 
        notices. There is no evidence of it being worked at the moment, but a 
        circumspect approach and a willingness to beat a hasty retreat are advised. 
        </p>
      <p><b>Character 
        </b></p>
      <p>The Cherry 
        Hinton Chalk Pit has an ideal aspect, sheltered from the wind and always 
        having at least one face towards the sun. The &quot;rock&quot; is a fairly 
        soft chalk which, due to quarrying, is often broken into large blocks. 
        As such it is very loose and extremely untrustworthy. There are more homogeneous 
        areas of chalk, but these have exhibited a worryingly short half-life. 
        </p>
      <p>In good 
        winter conditions the more broken chalk becomes frozen and more amenable 
        to climbing, particularly so on the Brenva Face. Care should be taken 
        here, as cornices form above the face, and sizable avalanches have been 
        noted. The pit should be avoided immediately after a thaw, due to rockfall. 
        </p>
      <p>Thick vegetation 
        is often a problem at the top of the crag, particularly on the Subsidiary 
        Wall, where the difficulties of escaping from it are considerably greater 
        than those to be found on the routes themselves. </p>
      <p><b>Equipment</b> 
        </p>
      <p>Although 
        some exponents have favoured EB&#146;s instead of crampons, most routes 
        have been ascended in full ice gear. Helmets are essential &#150; the 
        bigger the better! Ice screws and drive-ins have been used for protection, 
        but experience has shown that their chief function is to pull large quantities 
        of rock onto the head of the falling climber. Numerous tree belays are 
        available at the top of the crag. </p>
      <p>Grades are 
        given on the standard Dover I &#150; VII scale. </p>
      <p><b>History 
        </b> </p>
      <p>Although 
        it almost certain that Mummery and Mallory both graced these fine walls, 
        the first mention of the pits can only be traced to the CUMC Journal of 
        1934, in which an extensive article recommends them as the site of &quot;a 
        very pleasant Sunday afternoon&#146;s sport&quot;. It describes the rock 
        to be &quot;of extremely variable quality&quot; and among other things 
        suggests that would-be Alpinists practise abseiling there to gain experience 
        of heavy stonefall. Most interestingly it recommends the use of a light 
        hammer with a long spike to cut holds, and a domestic poker as a piton! 
        </p>
      <p>The only 
        other mention of the pits is to be found in a plan put forward by Cambridge 
        City Council in the 1950&#146;s to build a &quot;practice climbing wall&quot;. 
        Fortunately this piece of civic vandalism was never allowed to occur. 
        </p>
      <p>Little further 
        interest seems to have been shown until Richard Jones visited the crag 
        in the early 1980&#146;s, although as was to be expected, nothing of any 
        worth was ascended. It was not until the autumn of 1984 that development 
        took off, with Brian Davison spearheading the attack. Most of the routes 
        on the Brenva Face and Subsidiary Wall were ascended by Brian, Richard 
        Jones and Ray Delaney, including the superb &quot;Classic of the Crag&quot;. 
        Richard, replying to criticisms that his routes were merely fillers-in, 
        led Peter Clegg up &quot;Choss&quot; &#150; on the side of the Eckpfeiler 
        &#150; to produce an excellent filler&#150;in. The week after, Brian led 
        &quot;Pigstick&quot;, the superb hanging slab taking the full height of 
        the Eckpfeiler, to create the most serious route in the quarry to date. 
        </p>
      <p>During Feb 
        1985 the crag offered superb snow conditions and many lines were ascended 
        on the Brenva Face by Messrs. Clegg, Jones, Erskine and Austin, and Miss 
        Phillips. During this time several attempts were made on the Lauterbrennan 
        wall, all ending in failure or top-rope rescue. Most recently the Grot 
        Walls have been opened up Erskine and Clegg, with two extremely insignificant 
        routes &#150; &quot;Grot 1&quot; and &quot;Grot 2&quot;. </p>
      <p>The future 
        holds great promise. With Angus&#146; prize &#150; ten pounds for the 
        first ascent of the Lauterbrennan Wall &#150; still unclaimed, and the 
        chance of reclimbing existing routes after they&#146;ve fallen dawn, activity 
        should continue for many years to come. </p>
      <p><b>Routes</b></p>
      <p><b>Subsidiary 
        Wall</b> </p>
      <p>1) The Gully 
        (30&#146;, III) ** &#150; climb the obvious deep gully to an overhang 
        at the top. Good tree roots to finish. </p>
      <p><b>Brenva 
        Face</b> </p>
      <p>2) Manky 
        Corner (35&#146;, II/III) &#150; the corner direct. A poor climb. </p>
      <p>3) Scabies 
        (35&#146;, III) &#150; start 5 yards R of the previous route and ascend 
        the obvious R-wards line. </p>
      <p>A ledge 
        system splits the face at mid-height, and is widest in the central section. 
        This has yet to be traversed in it&#146;s entirety, but entertaining excursions 
        up to about grade III have been made. There is some abandoned cable on 
        the ledge, and it has been suggested that this be extended to form a via 
        ferrata for the benefit of less committed climbers. </p>
      <p>4) Route 
        Major Indirect (70&#146;, I/II) * &#150; about a third of the way along 
        the face climb an open groove (good bum-slide) to the cable. Traverse 
        20&#146; R and follow the obvious groove, stepping L at the top. </p>
      <p>5) Route 
        Major Direct (60&#146;, II/III) ** &#150; start 10 yards R of the Indirect 
        and climb a vague groove awkwardly to the break. Finish as above. </p>
      <p>5a) Right-hand 
        variation (60&#146;, III) ** &#150; as the Direct to the break. Move R 
        and climb the large groove above with an exciting swing R where it steepens. 
        </p>
      <p>6) Crown 
        of Thorns (60&#146;, III) ** &#150; about 50 yards R, past the old hut, 
        is a series of grassy ledges. The route follows these to a prickly finish. 
        </p>
      <p>It is doubtless 
        possible to climb anywhere on the central and R-hand sections of the face 
        at a reasonable standard, and future development is unlikely to be worth 
        recording. </p>
      <p><b>Grot 
        Walls </b> </p>
      <p>A poor area. 
        </p>
      <p>7) Grot 
        I (45&#146;, III) &#150; climb over the loose base wall and follow a relatively 
        solid groove to the top. </p>
      <p>8) Grot 
        II (45&#146;, Ill) &#150; follow a series of grass covered steps in the 
        centre of the wall. </p>
      <p><b>Eckpfeiler</b> 
        </p>
      <p>9) Choss 
        (50&#146;, IV) *** &#150; just R of the corner is a prominent hanging 
        block of solid chalk. From the R, gain the top of this with difficulty 
        (crux). Climb steeply leftwards over rock to the top. </p>
      <p>10) Pigstick 
        (65&#146;, V) *** &#150; start below the obvious slab of solid chalk to 
        the R of the ar&ecirc;te. Gain the slab and climb it diagonally L. Exit 
        steeply L on very poor rock. Note. Part of the slab has collapsed since 
        the first ascent, and it is uncertain how this will affect the grade. 
        </p>
      <p><b>Lauterbr&uuml;nnen 
        Wall </b></p>
      <p>The quarry 
        is at it&#146;s highest and steepest here, and despite determined attempts 
        and the lure of Angus&#146; Prize, the magnificent main section remains 
        virgin. At its RH end the wall decreases greatly in height. Two routes 
        ascend this flanking wal1. </p>
      <p>11) Mank 
        (30&#146;, III/IV) * &#150; start 10&#146; L of (12) and climb steeply 
        over blocky rock to a desperate gravel finish. </p>
      <p>12) Classic 
        of the Crag (25&#146;, III) *** &#150; climb the obvious wide groove. 
        A superb exercise in front-pointing. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately 
        this last route is beginning to bank out, due to the large avalanche cone 
        of debris knocked down by its many ascentionists. Hopefully some good 
        citizen with a JCB will one day remove this, and restore the route to 
        its full height and glory.<br>
        </p>
