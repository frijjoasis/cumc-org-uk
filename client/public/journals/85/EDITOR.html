      <p>The Cambridge 
        University Mountaineering Club has a considerable reputation to live up 
        to. In the days when mountaineering was a pastime for those sufficiently 
        wealthy or well-connected to afford both the time and the expense, Cambridge 
        rock-climbers were amongst the foremost of their generation, Cambridge 
        expeditions probed the remote mountains of the world, and Cambridge Mountaineering 
        was published in hardback (sigh). Today, hard rock-climbing is the prerogative 
        of the dedicated unemployed, the unexplored ranges are no more, and you 
        hold in your hand evidence of our sad decline. </p>
      <p>But before 
        I am accused of being a killjoy, I would like to look, on a more personal 
        level, at exactly what the CUMC is and does. </p>
      <p>To the outsider 
        that I was, a mountaineering club 300 miles from the nearest mountains 
        and 3 hours weary journey from any major climbing ground seemed a rather 
        futile joke. As a fresher the club consisted largely of an amorphous clique 
        who ignored me at the teas, and grudgingly accepted the company of myself 
        and other lost souls on the meets – provided we could look after ourselves. 
        With only occasional trips to wet gritstone crags, my climbing standard 
        plummeted. </p>
      <p>Yet now, 
        nearly two years later, I appreciate that only a little dedication and 
        pushiness are required to gain entry; accept, with a certain guilty reluctance, 
        that novice meets are a device to part the innocents from their money 
        whilst ensuring that only the keenest actually take up climbing; and enjoy 
        immensely the company that I keep. </p>
      <p>For the 
        CUMC is more than just a collection of people with a common interest in 
        mountaineering. It is a group of individuals with interests as diverse 
        as their activities: from extreme rock to the rooftops of Cambridge, marathon 
        running and marathon drinking, rally-car driving and minibus reshaping, 
        cycling to the Peak and canoeing to Granchester. From grade V ice to the 
        more esoteric pleasures of formation star-jumping, climbing is the nucleus, 
        but the club is an organic whole. And its most important function is to 
        help us come to know better not only the mountains, but ourselves and 
        each other. </p>
      <p>I think 
        Geoffrey Winthrop-Young would have approved. <br>
