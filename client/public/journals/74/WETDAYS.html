	  <P>GLENCOE 
		in September? You must be kidding. The water, the midges.... You’ve a 
		car? O.K., pick me up in Glasgow. </P>
	  <P>Never have 
		I regretted such a short ’phone call for so long. At least the tents are 
		waterproof, but the two-hundred-yard dash to the pub seems a long way, 
		and they are not open yet. </P>
	  <P>Rolling 
		over I bump into a brew: </P>
	  <P>&quot;Funny, 
		wasn’t there last night,&quot; then through the lingering shreds of sleep 
		it dawn on me; someone must be up, but who on a day like this? </P>
	  <P>Glebe’s 
		head pokes through the door: </P>
	  <P>&quot;Chug-a-lug, 
		breakfast in ten minutes.&quot; </P>
	  <P>I don’t 
		like this, he’s up and cooking. Pete must want to go somewhere. Must be 
		Fort Bill, no-one would go up the hill on a day like this. I sip my brew 
		contentedly, putting the vague possibility of venturing out into the rain 
		into the sleep that was still in my head. </P>
	  <P>The promised 
		breakfast arrived, the remnants of the haggis are quite tasty and were 
		distinguishable from the porridge that preceded it. Strange, Glebe seems 
		to be packing his sack. He doesn’t need a compass to go to the cinema. 
		I curl up in my pit and ignore the vision and its implications. </P>
	  <P>What! Martin 
		as well? He can’t want to go up the hill. I’ll get some support from Pete. 
		He’s sane and appreciates the good things in life. </P>
	  <P>Jeeze. It’s 
		a flaming plot, he wants to go too. O.K., I might as well get in the car 
		and persuade them to go for a fester. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Please 
		can we go to the cafe? It is too dangerous on the hill, Hamish would not 
		approve... Oh, my leg. My ligament has gone again.&quot; Rats, they don’t 
		believe me... &quot;I’ve forgotten my boots&quot; ... But I haven’t. As 
		we drive up the glen my mind races in an attempt to come up with a convincing 
		story to keep me out of the deep, wet, man-eating bogs. But my excuses 
		get weaker and weaker. We arrive at Lagangarbh. The rain stops and the 
		sun joins in the conspiracy. Game, Set and Match. </P>
	  <P>We all set 
		up the Buchaille… but I refuse to enjoy myself. They say it is only a 
		short walk, but why the ropes? I give up thinking and sink into a regular 
		mindless stride. Over the bridge with the footprints and on across the 
		bog by the path – path?; someone’s attempt at dry humour. Soon the water 
		seeps through the boots and I can feel the mud and water squelching about 
		when I move my toes. The drizzle returns, then changes to a damp mist 
		as we enter the dull grey world of clouds. Up past the waterfall and along 
		Curved Ridge, avoiding the puddles on the big holds. </P>
	  <P>Oh no. They’ve 
		stopped. I hope it’s just a coincidence that we are under Rannoch Wall. 
		The ropes are coming out, so I walk on up pretending I have not seen them. 
		Rats, they see me and I’ll have to go across. </P>
	  <P>&quot;What, 
		Agag’s? You are mad.&quot; Pete hands me a rope end and it is only after 
		I have tied on that I see he is already belayed at the font of the groove. 
		Now that’s just not nice, I think I will keep that blade of his that he 
		doesn’t know I’ve got. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Please, 
		I don’t want to go, I’m too young... Whimper... Snivel.&quot; Pete ignores 
		me as I lick his boots trying to barter my soul and all my gear for his 
		comfortable belay. In the end I am forced to leave him staring impassively 
		into the mist. </P>
	  <P>Somewhat 
		resigned to my fate, I set off. A brief struggle with an obnoxious corner 
		that seemed to dislike me as much as I it, and I find a large ledge with 
		a good Moac crack. I tie myself securely to the rock to stop Pete from 
		making me lead. He comes silently up and, much to my relief, leads through, 
		up a long ramp of wet rock. When I eventually reach him he points leftwards 
		to a steep wall that had &quot;crux&quot; written all over it. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Piece 
		of duff,&quot; Pete says with obvious glee. That I treat with the contempt 
		it deserves, and accidentally brushing my wet cagoule into his face, I 
		wandered off aimlessly trying to ignore the wall. But, inevitably, I arrived 
		at its foot. The gleam in Pete’s eye is visible through the mist and rain, 
		forty runnerless feet away. I smooth a tape over a rounded bulge and move 
		delicately up, finding a lovely crack that is a haven for any self-respecting 
		nut. Feeling better, I carry on. That, next to getting up in the morning, 
		is my biggest mistake. The wall leans out, I lean out, but by using a 
		dubious hand jam I find my right hand fondling a beautiful jug that just 
		demands to be pulled on. Two seconds later I had heaved, pulled, pushed 
		and mantleshelfed cum rolled into a big puddle (or small lochen) on .html 
		palatial ledge. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Jeeze, 
		that’s fun,&quot; I think, then change my mind as I remember I’m not to 
		enjoy myself. When Pete arrives I again pass judgment on the weather and 
		the wisdom of climbing in it, but the grin on his face shows he can see 
		through my fa&ccedil;ade. He points out that I managed to smile when I 
		got the nut in, and laughed when I found the jug. </P>
	  <P>Another 
		easy pitch leads to the top, where we meet Glebe and Martin, who had done 
		Original Route. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Have 
		fun?&quot; Glebe asks. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Well,&quot; 
		I reply, &quot;it’s a good route.&quot; </P>
	  <P>He seems 
		to think that this implies I enjoyed it. </P>
	  <P>&quot;But 
		the conditions are bloody awful, slimy rock, nasty wind... cold... &quot; 
		I am still mumbling as they wander off up the Crowberry Ridge, laughing. 
		</P>
	  <P>The walk 
		to the top is uneventful. Silently we all relive the climb in our minds, 
		and after losing Great Gully in typical CUMC fashion, we eventually find 
		our way down to the Claichaig in time for a pre-prandial pint. </P>
	  <P>Sitting 
		in the warmth of the public bar, the day’s activities retreat to a respectable 
		distance, where one can survey them with calm and tranquility. </P>
	  <P>&quot;We 
		rescued a good day from the rain; better than festering in Fort Bill,&quot; 
		someone mumbles. </P>
	  <P>&quot;A 
		fine mountaineering day,&quot; agreed some Murray-ite. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Aye,&quot; 
		I conceded, &quot;I’m glad I persuaded youse poms to come.&quot; </P>
	  <P>The brown 
		liquid trickled down my neck as the rest of the bar dissolved into laughter. 
		</P>
