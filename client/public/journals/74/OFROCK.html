	  <P>HAVING sleep-walked 
		to the Senate House that morning, my first real recollection of the day 
		is of the more or less standard plate of orange frog spawn (beans on toast 
		to the uninformed), which even in those days cost one and a half tubes. 
		</P>
	  <P>Surprisingly 
		unchunderous, we arrived and joined the queue for routes. Responding to 
		cries of &quot;Move along de edge please,&quot; we eventually arrived 
		at an unoccupied &quot;diff". Like frustrated psyched-out spiders, divvies 
		were already dangling from ropes above, in their first attempts to abseil. 
		Fighting through the grockles (who�d decided to have a day out at the 
		zoo), and kicking aside several beer cans, our small contribution to the 
		annual divvies outing arrived at the bottom of a crack. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Where�s 
		the big divvy?&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Gone 
		to park one in the cave&quot;... </P>
	  <P>And so the 
		day went on. </P>
	  <P>Boredom 
		was well set in after about the third Mars bar, although one route in 
		particular held an unexpected surprise. Evidence of someone else�s disapproval 
		of this climb had been left: the experience of mantel-shelfing onto a 
		ledge, and landing with my knee in a turd, not only persuaded me to improve 
		my technique, but also worked up the necessary appetite for .html couple 
		of butties. Obviously untrained in the diversified aspects of rock climbing, 
		no-one else would follow me up that route. Having demolished the rest 
		of my butties, it was time to scale yet .html &quot;V. Diff.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Little divvy 
		was climbing in shoes and was somewhat gripped after &quot;back and footing&quot; 
		up a short chimney He had arrived at a large capstone at the top, and 
		could not move an inch in any direction. Meanwhile, my bowels were trying 
		to tell me something, and unable to curb myself any longer, I dropped 
		a big enough hint at the bottom of the chimney to persuade &quot;little 
		divvy&quot; to finish the route. </P>
	  <P>A thoroughly 
		knackered and extremely bored 4 p.m. came around. I found myself festering 
		at the base of a thin crack, which quickly disappeared into a prepuce 
		of overhanging flakes. Enthusiasm for doing a route momentarily took over 
		(although I�m ashamed to admit it), and I quickly slithered up the bed 
		of green slime that lay in the crack. Already shattered and uttering assorted 
		pig impressions, I continued. On reaching the overhanging flakes both 
		holds and co-ordination seemed to have run out. The sound effects had 
		now expanded to include an assortment of farmyard animals, not to mention 
		a whole herd of pigs. Whilst greatly impressing the grockles at the bottom 
		of the crag, this impression of a multi-schizophrenic Percy Edwards did 
		very little for my jamming. By this time I was grovelling frantically 
		for a positive hold but to no avail. </P>
	  <P>Big divvy�s 
		facial expression as I made an attempt to jump on him, distracted me from 
		various visions of the past. In fact I had barely emerged from my mother�s 
		womb before I was seated on the ground, uttering assorted obscenities 
		and attracting a large crowd of bewildered novices. </P>
	  <P>Having hit 
		the local headlines in a big way, it was time to return home, all but 
		two weeks late. I had just sussed out the various timber aids that are 
		necessary to transport the average failed climber along on his arms. There 
		was no lack of incentive, as after two weeks, the exotic delights of transporting 
		oneself to a place that most &quot;normals&quot; visit every day, provided 
		the much needed climax to end a fortnight�s bed-bound intoxication. The 
		use of a hospital bedpan had quickly been demonstrated as unwise by the 
		&quot;bike-prang&quot; in the bed next to mine. Thus to avoid soiling 
		the sheets (that is with quantities of excrement � large), there was only 
		one method � restraint. The outcome is the everlasting memory of being 
		wedged firmly (by a full leg plaster) across this small room, screaming 
		frantically to be rescued. This can only be excelled by the sheer ecstatic 
		sensation of passed frustration, second only to a long awaited orgasm. 
		</P>
	  <P>A.S. (died 
		October �72, and many times since). </P>
