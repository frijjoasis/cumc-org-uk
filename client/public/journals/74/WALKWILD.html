	  <P>WALKING 
		on up the track, going dusky soon but still a long way to go. Round by 
		the old lodge and up the hill to meet darkness on the ridge. One torch, 
		a lot of stumbling down slabs and falling into bogs. At last the comforting 
		sight of the Dubh Loch which is probably worth a few lines of poetic meanderings. 
		I suppose it’s beautiful. So what! </P>
	  <P>We pitched 
		our tent on a higher bit of bog than the rest and cooked up a meal, then 
		a cup of coffee, half of which is drunk and half spilt an the groundsheet 
		in careful abandon. </P>
	  <P>Now a well 
		earned rest and then morning. Adding egg to the coffee, we scrambled up 
		to the foot of the crag. Climbing seems to be the thing to do when you’re 
		in the mountains and although less satisfying than other activities (like 
		what? – Ed.) we felt like a change and uncoiled the rope. Jimmy led up 
		and I followed with a cold wind blowing excuses at us up the valley. </P>
	  <P>Jimmy was 
		not to be put off and up he went. His mind must have been wandering because 
		he had to belt a linger with his peg hammer to remind himself what he 
		was doing. On a bit more and .html mistake. He let go of the rock and 
		ended up ten foot from the stance. He was still a little determined as 
		he climbed back up, banged out the peg and climbed back down again. Abseil 
		back down again and that’s the end of the day’s climbing Oh well! We wander 
		over and have a look at the slabs. </P>
	  <P>The meal 
		is cooked in the dusk. The rice is emptied out of Jimmy’s rucksack into 
		the pan and we pick out the bigger bits of glass and two fag ends. We 
		eat the meal, both engrossed in our thoughts which often seem fairly similar. 
		(What about rolling a joint? – Ed.) We reckoned we should have brought 
		a couple of fur-burgers but hadn’t and we managed without as usual. (Modesty.– 
		Ed.) </P>
	  <P>Next day, 
		leaving a drop of evaporated milk on the floor, we head off up to the 
		slabs to do &quot;Pink Elephant&quot;. This time a bit more success. Just 
		as cold but we must be getting used to it. It was really good climbing 
		and we were having a great time despite losing the route around the terrace. 
		We start up the upper section to a big overhang and some very nice traversing 
		to avoid it, with the ropes making nice patterns on the rock. (F. Far 
		Out.– Ed.) </P>
	  <P>And so it 
		starts to snow. Just lightly but I was impressed. It was only September 
		but Jimmy reassured me. It often snows in September so I was set at ease. 
		The flakes got thicker and the rock got wetter and hands number. Jimmy 
		climbs the pitch in the shower and it stops as I start. It’s good having 
		GOD on your side. I go through. One more chimney and we’re up. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Bloody 
		great.&quot; </P>
	  <P>We have 
		a fag and descend happily into the dismal gully with still plenty of energy 
		left for the night. </P>
	  <P>Another 
		meal and we flake stale bread onto the floor to make the chunder more 
		solid. In the morning, well stuffed, we set off up the mountain. King 
		Rat today. More great climbing. This time steeper with a nice dangle from 
		an overhang with a rusty old leeper as a prize. We are slightly surprised 
		to do 2½ good pitches in one rope-length and 300 ft. of easy gully at 
		the top in 150 ft. which explains why climbs are longer in Scotland. </P>
	  <P>Yet .html 
		night and we head out for Glen Clova. Seeing a Landrover after a couple 
		of hours we are disappointed to find that it’s not the Queen or Princess 
		Anne but instead a couple of game- keepers dressed in the height of fashion. 
		We ask the time. 10 o’clock. This comes as a shock. We must have been 
		getting up at about 7 every morning. They wish us on our way in a friendly 
		manner. &quot;You shouldn’t be on the hill at this time of year y’know. 
		You’ll get a bullet round the ear!&quot; </P>
	  <P>And so down 
		to the valley and after a couple of pints we head back on the road. </P>
	  <P><B>Punch-line:</B> 
		Craig an Dubh Loch’s the place where they say &quot;Take a walk on the 
		Wild Side!&quot; </P>
