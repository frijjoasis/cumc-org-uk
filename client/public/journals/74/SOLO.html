	  <P>IT was a 
		fine evening in August at a hut high above Chamonix. From within came 
		a hum of. voices and the occasional laugh, as tired climbers cooked their 
		evening meal. On the raised parapet running round the terrace outside 
		a solitary figure was seated, knees drawn up to his chin, thoughtfully 
		smoking a pipe. Puffs of smoke hung motionless in the still air. Behind 
		him, the long glacier and the path running up the moraine at its side 
		were in shadow, but the mountains still glowed golden. Up the path trudged 
		a few late-comers. It was a peaceful scene, to which the contemplative 
		figure formed a foreground. So thought the little group of tourists standing 
		in the doorway. They were spending the night at the hut to witness an 
		alpine sunrise. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Their 
		faces would be a picture if they knew what I was thinking,&quot; said 
		Richard Farral to himself sardonically, as he sat on the wall aware that 
		he was being watched. He was small and wiry, with a fair moustache that 
		stood out startlingly against the ruddy tan of his face. His light gold 
		hair was short and carefully brushed. His breeches and sweater, of continental 
		make, were expensive but unpretentious. He was an unpretentious figure. 
		Studiedly so, some might have said, had he given them the chance to know 
		him well enough. But no one ever had known him well. Not even Will. </P>
	  <P>Their attention 
		caught, the tourists went on to notice the small, slightly puckered mouth 
		and the light crowsfeet about his eyes, of which he was privately rather 
		proud. He exuded an air of self-sufficiency. This must be a famous guide, 
		they thought with some awe, and turned to the hut warden for confirmation. 
		Farrel heard the question as they went inside. He could imagine the reply: 
		&quot;No. that is M. Farrel, the English climber. It was he who soloed 
		the Eiger Direct last summer. He put up a new route on the Eckpfeiler 
		Buttress only a month ago. The greatest alpinist since Bonatti.&quot; 
		</P>
	  <P>Farrel smiled 
		to himself, a queer satisfied little smile. Yes, it was pleasant to be 
		famous, to see recognition and respect dawn in the warden’s face as he 
		handed in his S.A.C. card, to have a press reporter from Italy or France 
		or Germany, though rarely Britain ("a prophet is not without honour...&quot; 
		he used to reflect), waiting for him after a climb with a drink and a 
		free meal and perhaps the offer of payment for exclusive rights. He had 
		no qualms about any mythical amateur status, though .he refused to earn 
		a living by guiding or instructing. In point of fact he had no need to 
		earn a living. His father had died several years before, leaving him a 
		wealthy man, and now he lived in Switzerland, skiing in the winter, climbing 
		in the summer, and disappearing no-one knew where, in between. Yet he 
		was careful to remain the quiet modest Englishman in his dealings with 
		the press. Yes, it was very pleasant. But really it meant nothing, he 
		reminded himself. There was nothing for him to live for. He was merely 
		filling in time, so to speak. Dutifully almost, he thought back to that 
		day six years ago when Will died... </P>
	  <P>They had 
		been descending a steep treacherous slope. The snow was soft and soggy 
		in the afternoon sun, and beneath it was ice. They were both tired. When 
		he heard thc frightening shout, he realised he had been expecting it all 
		along. They should have been belaying, he knew. But he had felt confident 
		in himself and, although Will was less experienced and obviously not happy, 
		he had decided, in the arrogance or petulance of his fatigue, that that 
		was so much the worse for Will. Now, as Will slid down towards him, his 
		axe slicing through the snow and scraping uselessly on the ice beneath 
		in his vain efforts to brake, Farral realised it was so much the worse 
		for both of them. There wasn’t a hope of holding Will. He had plenty of 
		time to realise it. Too much perhaps. For as Will’s despairing face rushed 
		past, and he felt his own pick make no impression on the ice, his horror 
		turned to rage. The fool, the fool. what right had he to kill them both. 
		Impulsively he unclipped the karabiner at his waist – thank God he never 
		bothered with screw-gates- – then took out the figure-of-eight. Next instant 
		it was snatched from his hand as the 150-foot rope came tight, and he 
		watched fascinated as one of Will’s crampons caught and he disappeared 
		over the edge of the ice-fall below, somersaulting. </P>
	  <P>He had spent 
		a further week in the area as he knew would be expected of him, looking 
		after a few formalities, but mostly sitting about wearing an appropriately 
		disconsolate mask. Beneath it he was still angry with Will, angry at being 
		placed in such an equivocal position. It seemed perfectly natural that 
		he should have obeyed the instinct of self-preservation. Will’s death 
		was his own fault. Why should he, Farral, have to die too? Yet he could 
		imagine the outraged reaction in the Alpine Club, in the mountaineering 
		press. It just wasn’t cricket, was it? His anger stemmed from fear lest 
		the body, with rope and tell-tale figure-of-eight attached, should be 
		found to incriminate him. He had never needed friends, but he did need 
		to be accepted and admired. So he appeared convincingly sick at heart 
		when he plodded up to the foot of the ice-fall with the search party They 
		failed to find the body, however, and it became apparent that Will had 
		disappeared for ever down one of the blue chasms of the ice-fall. </P>
	  <P>As his fear 
		of discovery lessened, he began to feel, not so much remorse as a certain 
		self-regarding melancholy. For he had read Shakespeare and Dostoevsky 
		and he was aware of the ways in which guilt can manifest itself in the 
		human mind, though personally he had always found Iago more comprehensible 
		than Raskolnikov. Gradually he convinced himself that life could have 
		no more meaning for him. He could only court death, or defy it, in the 
		way most open to him. He could even quote to himself: </P>
	  <DIR> 
		<DIR> 
		  <P>Come 
			wind, come wrack, <BR>
			At least we’ll die with harness on our back. </P>
		</DIR>
	  </DIR>
	  <P>Of course, 
		in reality, he was giving his life a meaning for the first time. In the 
		past he had shown potential for almost anything he turned his hand to, 
		hut a kind of cynical indifference, a spoilt world-weariness, had marred 
		all his efforts. Always the will had been lacking for real success. In 
		his climbing, he had possessed the technique but not the incentive to 
		climb the hardest routes in the Alps. Now, in the carefully nurtured, 
		if largely unconscious, fiction of his despair, he found that will, and 
		began the series of bold solo climbs that made him famous. He never carried 
		a rope. While he was front-pointing on steep black ice that swept for 
		two thousand feet below him, or climbing loose vertical rock, he was enabled 
		by a sort of unthinking indifference so to concentrate on overcoming that 
		particular obstacle, on reaching the top, on succeeding, that his mind 
		was excluded and he was without fear. When he was not climbing, and his 
		mind maybe began to wonder at these feats, he diverted it to the spectre 
		of Will and the black emptiness which that engendered. And all the time 
		he basked secretly, unknown even to himself probably, in the aura of adulation 
		that surrounded him. His name, disseminated by Eurovision and the Press, 
		became a household word all over Europe. His reputation could hardly increase. 
		</P>
	  <P>It was a 
		fact of which he was becoming aware. Recently he had begun to feel a restlessness 
		and dissatisfaction he had not known since he wrapped the black mantle 
		of despair so snugly about himself. He could not acknowledge as much to 
		himself. But a vague unease was even then undermining the complacency 
		of that tranquil-seeming figure on the terrace. </P>
	  <P>Two young 
		Frenchmen approached. Beautiful evening, wasn’t it? It boded well for 
		the morrow, didn’t he think? They chatted for a while. The Frenchmen were 
		deferential. He was quietly affable, slightly condescending, but only 
		slightly. And was he climbing tomorrow? Yes, he was attempting the North 
		Face of Le Doight, he replied in the clipped, rather formal manner he 
		affected even in his not-quite-fluent French. Just a classic he had never 
		done, he explained apologetically. Ah, they were doing the same themselves. 
		Quite a coincidence, wasn’t it, when the face was so rarely climbed. No 
		doubt they would meet – near the bottom, at any rate (the speed with which 
		he climbed was legendary). Farral nodded and raised his eyebrows as much 
		as to say &quot;Perhaps&quot;, and they wished him Bonsoir. </P>
	  <P>He was woken 
		at one o’clock and made his way downstairs in the dark. No other climbers 
		were up yet. A quick cup of coffee and he was picking his way over the 
		moraine to the glacier. There was only the faintest hint of dawn in the 
		sky as he started up the face. It was notorious for stonefall once the 
		sun reached it. He gained height rapidly, the two head-torches that had 
		flickered after him across the glacier, dropping far below. </P>
	  <P>Nonetheless, 
		he was curiously nervous. For the first time in years he was worrying, 
		disturbed by the ignominy should the Frenchmen overtake him. His reputation 
		would be damaged. Suddenly he realised how much it meant to him, that 
		reputation. Yet he was perched on a pinnacle, able to go no higher, only 
		to fall. And what if he should fall, literally? The thought admitted, 
		the question asked, fear swept over him. His muscles tensed and he lost 
		the relaxed rhythm which was the essence of his speed. Then, as if a charm 
		had been broken, the rock-fall came. </P>
	  <P>Hitherto 
		he had always been lucky. Of course, there had been narrow escapes. But 
		he had never actually fallen, never been avalanched, never even been hit 
		by stones. Now, with only the briefest rumble of warning, he was in the 
		midst of a storm of rocks and boulders. Something smashed his left shoulder. 
		He nearly fainted and lurched insecurely on his front points. A sudden 
		blow on the wrist caused him involuntarily to let go of his axe. Some 
		seconds later he heard an angry yell from below. Evidently it had hit, 
		or narrowly missed one of the Frenchmen, he did not greatly care which. 
		He was trembling all over, cowering against the ice. When the last stones 
		had whistled past, he made his way, faint with pain and shock, to a little 
		cluster of rocks jutting out of the ice, carefully, laboriously cutting 
		steps with his north-wall hammer. Belaying himself with the same slow 
		attention to detail, he sank down on n little rock platform. </P>
	  <P>The Frenchmen 
		duly arrived. The stones had missed them, but Farral’s axe had very nearly 
		hit the leader. They shouted indignantly, and when he remained silent, 
		enquired after him anxiously. He did not appear badly hurt, however, and 
		eventually they shrugged their shoulders and left him in peace. Peace 
		was all he wanted, in that hour of recognition. He sat there, seeing with 
		stereoscopic clarity how he had deceived himself. He knew now that he 
		had never felt any guilt for Will’s death. He knew that he had climbed 
		not from despair, but from vanity and pride. And Nemesis had found him 
		finally. That very pride had betrayed him to himself. Fear of failure 
		had reawakened the fear of death which his will, in its blind power, had 
		stifled. He smiled bitterly, seeing in himself all the paradox and awful 
		anagnorisis of the tragic hero. And then he realised that he was neither 
		tragic nor a hero, but something infinitely small and pitiable. The scaffolding 
		which had supported his ego in its total isolation, had been swept away 
		with the stones. Face to face with the reality for the first time in his 
		life, he sang into a dreamy vacuum in which he gazed with detachment on 
		his crushed, throbbing shoulders. The hours passed. He was dimly aware 
		that he ought to move, that his position was unsafe. But his mind could 
		not focus, his limbs seemed no longer his. An effort was needed, but the 
		will was gone. He lay emptied of all emotion or thought, yet warm and 
		somehow content, as if a fatal opiate were at work. Dully, he watched 
		a miniature cascade of water running down the rock beside him, where the 
		ice in a crack had been melted by the sun. The rough granite was almost 
		hot beneath his palms. Drowsily he closed his eyes. </P>
	  <P>The Frenchmen 
		returned to the hut late in the afternoon and reported that they had last 
		seen the mad Englishman sitting on a ledge in the middle of the face. 
		A new group of tourists were on the terrace. Binoculars turned onto the 
		speck of red that stood out so clearly when they knew where to look. At 
		that moment, as if the gods, in deference to what they assumed would be 
		his wish, had waited for an audience before pulling down the curtain, 
		a massive section of cliff broke away from the upper rock-band, carving 
		a broad swathe down the centre of the face. </P>
	  <P>When the 
		obliterating dust and snow had cleared, the little red dot was gone. Next 
		day the papers were full of it. </P>
