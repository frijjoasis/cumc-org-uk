	  <P>NICK Estcourt 
		is one of the better known products of the C.U.M.C., so when he visits 
		us on the pretext of having been to the Himalayas with a camera round 
		his neck, he merits a welcome fit for any celebrated personality. Careful 
		preparations are made; foul-tasting sherry, a heater to produce a warm 
		atmosphere of cliqueyness; all courtesy of the general public. Graduating 
		from P.l, people drift to the Eros and then to the more liquid comforts 
		of a pub. Whisky, beer and smoke, swallowed for the sake of images, induce 
		a euphoria of carelessness as the lecture becomes a hazy hour of rain 
		and snow, blue and white, but predominantly of some sod attacking my head 
		with a hammer. </P>
	  <P>Supping 
		ale in the Bun Shop, my silent reminiscences are broken as somebody drags 
		me into a car heading north to the Ben. Visions of the icy clutches of 
		Scotland skate across my thoughts, the greedy gullies waiting to swallow 
		the unwary and spew them out in a bloody, mangled heap in the lower corries. 
		Crampons and hammers rattle rhythmically over bumps, and my body blissfully 
		slips into unconsciousness, a sense of impending doom lurking in the corners 
		of my mind. The rest of the party feel buoyed up by the tense expectancy 
		of physical hardship and cold. </P>
	  <P>Sleep is 
		a welcome relief as Newark disappears into the darkness. But awareness 
		is not so welcome when a stroppy copper inquires as to whether our perverted 
		antics of the last few weeks included the murder of a sixteen-year-old 
		girl. Satisfied that our tents are not bodies, he waves us away, and my 
		mind wanders aimlessly over girls, caressing their limbs and eventually 
		exploding in a scream as the car halts at a cafe. Coffee at four in the 
		morning dissipates some of the pain but the everpresent ashtray in my 
		mouth overcomes the warmth and leaves me choking down yesterday’s meals. 
		Crawling into a pub in Fort William sensibility returns, and with it a 
		growing sense of excitement as snow covered slopes promise good conditions. 
		A wasted day of drink and smoke terminates in an exhausted collapse somewhere 
		in the boggy heather of the walk-in. </P>
	  <P>The meandering 
		odour of breakfast stirs the nerves, poking messages at my nose and mouth, 
		which open to be filled with sausages and eggs. Coffee follows coffee 
		and bog follows bog; I smoke a fag while the others arrive. Gear is produced, 
		we split up, and set off. The tenseness of stomach muscles brought on 
		by the sight of ice-filled gullies and snow-covered buttresses is driven 
		away by the aches and numbness of tired limbs. The mist curls over the 
		edge of the plateau undecided in its direction, and then plunges down 
		the precipices, slivers of whiteness touch our heads, overcome visibility, 
		and leave us in a blankness overpowering in its completeness. A landmark 
		seems familiar from previous visits and a tortuous but safe route deposits 
		us at the foot of a shallow depression in the rocks. Filled with easy 
		angled snow, we run up it, laughing with enjoyment, and collapse in a 
		shallow cave. </P>
	  <P>&quot;An 
		ice pitch,&quot; moans Chas, looking ahead while I cough up a year of 
		cigarettes and idleness onto the beautiful unbroken snow. I lead off, 
		thankfully running out of rope as I touch ice. </P>
	  <P>Chas floats 
		past me on a cushion of nothingness and disappears into the mist, hammer 
		swinging and feet dancing on the ice </P>
	  <P>I’m buried 
		under spindrift as he throws down all the snow that ever existed. It creeps 
		under my hats, into my shirt, melting to trickle icely down to my boots, 
		where it acknowledges submission and transforms into warm water. My belay 
		disappears as Chas pulls our only deadboy up and security goes with it. 
		At last the rope is tight and I crawl over bare rock, tool scraping uselessly 
		on the unyielding mountain. </P>
	  <P>I pass my 
		partner and all worries disappear as I concentrate solely on climbing. 
		Pushing a screw in for useless psychological protection, I edge my way 
		up. A final pull over an apparently overhanging bulge and I collapse. 
		Fag after fag soothes my nerves as Chas first follows, then leads me up 
		the last easy pitches. Safety arrives at the horizontal plateau, a hilarious 
		semi-glissade to the hut, a long trek down to the tent, endless brews 
		and finally the Jacobite. </P>
	  <P>Tongues 
		of fire lick the water off my breeches and I sink into a stupor. Hours 
		pass by and an eternity of sleep becomes finite. Eyes open, familiar shapes 
		reorientate the brain, bringing me home in a car full of music and warmth, 
		to bed and inevitably work. </P>
