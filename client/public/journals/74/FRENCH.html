		<H1>THE FRENCH SCENE</H1>
		<H2>R. H. CRAWSHAW</H2>
	  </DIV>
	  
	  <P>THE French 
		are often thought to be over-stylised, over-romantic and over-nationalistic 
		in their approach to climbing as they are sometimes seen to be in their 
		approach to everything else. Certainly this image of French attitudes 
		is not diminished by a visit to a national gala such as the 20th anniversary 
		of Annapurna or the film of the Makalu expedition. On both occasions films 
		of &quot;previous French triumphs in the Himalaya&quot; were greeted with 
		cheers and clapping each time the Tricolor was hoisted on yet .html 
		peak. However, such overt symptoms of nationalism are not present when 
		meeting Paris climbers themselves, and it is worthwhile considering some 
		of the French climbing institutions, areas, techniques and individuals 
		in an effort to understand some of the elements peculiar to the French 
		scene. </P>
	  <P>Generally 
		speaking French climbing institutions could be described as similar in 
		many ways to those in this country. National organisations such as the 
		C.A.F. and the G.H.M. set the standards and preside over local and university 
		clubs. However, climbing itself in France tends to be much more of a family 
		activity. At Fontainebleau at weekends wives and small children complete 
		with P.A.s, follow the circuits with everyone else, a scene which might 
		perhaps be compared to Harrisons on a fine day. But this activity also 
		extends itself to the high mountains where families or inexperienced climbers 
		take guides or go on one of the many courses run by the C.A.F. We were 
		surprised at the Triden bivouac hut by a guide with a family of parents 
		and two children in tow who were spending ten days in the mountains before 
		going off to the &quot;Cote d’azur&quot; for the rest of their holiday. 
		The C.A.F. with its many local &quot;sections&quot; is the main organising 
		body and runs Alpine courses of different standards similar to those of 
		the old M.A. They mostly hire &quot;aspirant-guides&quot; to lead the 
		parties, The same system is used by the university clubs. So the section 
		of the population which in this country would be involved in &quot;outward-bound&quot; 
		type activities seems in France to be orientated more directly towards 
		easier Alpine mountaineering. The traditional institution representing 
		the mountaineering elite is still the G.H.M. which broadly speaking combines 
		the functions of the A.C. and the A.C.G, in Britain. At the same time 
		the &quot;Ecole nationale de Ski et Alpinisme&quot; based on Chamonix, 
		runs courses for instructors and trains and selects future guides. </P>
	  <P>The Paris 
		group hangs together purely through personalities, locality and climbing 
		interest. The &quot;dobbers&quot; of the late fifties and early sixties 
		such as Paragot and Barardini, have taken over from the Herzog, Magnone, 
		Franco generation as the representatives of the French climbing establishment 
		though the &quot;freaked out&quot; Claude Deck, secretary of the G.H.M., 
		defies definition. The generosity of climbers like Eric Vola, renowned 
		for his drinking and maniacal driving, with whom I went climbing several 
		times, and the sociality of people like Bougerolles, Mroz,and Denise Escan 
		makes talk of Anglo-French suspicion absurd. Climbers such as Mazeaud 
		seem to be viewed with the same wry irony as they are over here. The &quot;Mountain&quot; 
		article on the international Everest expedition was a source of much amusement 
		to the Paris climbers who read it. Andrzej Mroz was truly the centre of 
		the group. He climbed with everybody and was the initiator of most of 
		the Paris activity which was taking place in the winter of 1971/2, His 
		death on the Noire must have been a tremendous blow both to the Paris 
		group and to French climbing in general. </P>
	  <P>The Paris 
		group have not surprisingly remained quite distinct from any of the local 
		guides’ societies though some of them have themselves become &quot;aspirant-guides&quot;, 
		The reason for this detachment amounting sometimes to antipathy is because 
		of the extreme difficulty of becoming and making a living as a guide. 
		This entails a two week &quot;stage&quot; run by the E.N.S.A. at Chamonix 
		which about 50 per cent of applicants pass. A number of &quot;courses&quot; 
		are prescribed in order to be eligible for this &quot;aspirant-guide&quot; 
		qualification. A period of two or three years is subsequently demanded 
		during which time the &quot;aspirant-guide&quot; must have had a minimum 
		amount of experience guiding parties for clubs or private clients and 
		have completed a further number of &quot;courses&quot;. There is a further 
		&quot;stage&quot; for the &quot;Brevet de guide&quot;. But even when recognised 
		nationally as a guide, it is difficult to build up a sufficiently large 
		clientele without being a member of one of the local &quot;societies&quot; 
		which is very difficult unless one has been a local resident from birth. 
		Things have apparently eased slightly since the Terray, Rebuffat admissions 
		to the S.G.C., but the three year gamble for only summer employment is 
		more than most are prepared to risk. The result is that most of the Paris 
		group are in full-time employment and can only get away to climb at weekends 
		or over holiday periods. </P>
	  <P>The Parisians 
		are prepared to travel considerable distances at weekends. If winter climbing 
		at Chamonix is &quot;on&quot;, an all-night drive followed by a drive 
		up in the &quot;telepherique&quot; and a bivouac on Saturday night is 
		by no means unheard of. Possible alternatives to the Mont Blanc area by 
		way of mountain routes are the Vercors and the Devoluy, East and West 
		of Grenoble respectively, which provide sheer, limestone cliffs of 3,000 
		ft and longer. The climbing there is spectacular and on a Dolomitic scale. 
		Parts of the Devoluy are still remarkably and beautifully wild and the 
		area is only now being opened up, Many new lines remain to be climbed 
		and it is here that much of the activity was concentrated. Weekend departures 
		for the Alps or areas such as these seem to be planned very casually and 
		at the last moment. Eric, having been excited about the necessity of getting 
		gear ready and of leaving on time to the Devoluy, arrived from work half 
		an hour late, rushed off to buy food for the route, then suggested that 
		we drive round to Mroz’s to pick up some information about the area and 
		to ask where the route went. On returning to Eric’s, we found Jean Afanasief 
		with a hurt leg having just been knocked off his bicycle which had no 
		brakes. When he had been given a lift across Paris to his brother who 
		was a doctor – &quot;Do you climb?&quot; &quot;Yeah, from time to time...&quot; 
		&quot;You know Cliff Phillips?&quot;... &quot;Er...&quot; &quot;Alan Rouse?...&quot; 
		– we drove back to Eric’s to find him relaxing over a large meal saying 
		it wasn’t worth leaving yet because of the traffic. It was about 10.30 
		when we finally got away with no prospect of sleep the other end about 
		6 a.m. when we arrived at the barn where Mroz and Bougerolles had already 
		been asleep for four hours. Ben, the American and I managed a quick 2½ 
		hours. Not so Eric, who was hopping about, cigarette in mouth, wondering 
		when we were going to start. After an exhausting slog up interminable 
		screes, Eric banged off up the climb and after spending an uncomfortable 
		night due to inadequate bivvy gear, still appeared equally chirpy at the 
		top. Earlier in September, he had done the Paris-Marseille run in 5½ hours 
		for a quick weekend in the Calanques. Two other climbers on the route 
		had come all the way from Rennes in the north-west of France. </P>
	  <P>The French 
		make a clear difference between &quot;la Montagne&quot; and &quot;1’&eacute;cole&quot;, 
		that is between mountain routes and nursery outcrops. Outcrop climbing 
		is regarded as training ground for the big hills. There are several much 
		frequented training areas in the Paris region of which the best known 
		are Fontainbleau and La Saussois. Fontainebleau is a large forest, strewn 
		with sandstone boulders grouped in hillocks across about 400 square miles. 
		The area is about 60 miles south of Paris and people flock there on sunny 
		weekends. In winter it becomes the hard man’s playground with problems 
		ranging from easy to totally desperate. Within each group of rocks, circuits 
		of various levels have been categorised according to Alpine grading. Arrows 
		of the appropriate colour indicate the exact route. Individual problems 
		of sufficient length and interest are themselves graded from I-VI The 
		grading is generally considerably higher than in the Alps. Steel-fingered 
		monkey-men and girls in bikinis leap and swing from hold to hold chattering 
		gaily. Moves are often dynamic with a spring to the hold above which one 
		finds difficult to imagine possible with any sort of lead out. Proximity 
		to the ground makes it possible to attempt the desperate, though in fact 
		the end of a problem may be as much as twenty – twenty-five feet off the 
		ground. Individual problems become obsessions to which one returns every 
		weekend and there is no doubt that finger strength as well as technique 
		improve remarkably as one becomes accustomed to the nature of the rock. 
		</P>
	  <P>The other 
		main Paris areas is the &quot;Saussois&quot;, a series of limestone outcrops 
		about 180 miles south of Paris. The holds are small and polished and routes 
		are of a very high standard. However, as in all &quot;&eacute;coles&quot;, 
		pitons abound and all hard moves are very well protected and generally 
		involve direct aid. The area is the origin of Terray’s &quot;Saussois&quot; 
		boots which are light, totally rigid and lace down to the toes. They are 
		ideal for all limestone climbing and for pure rock routes in the Alps 
		and are much used by the French climbers. </P>
	  <P>The obvious 
		difference in technique is in the use of pegs. Since &quot;&eacute;coles&quot; 
		are merely training grounds there are no ethical limitations though on 
		most outcrops ample numbers of pegs are in place and putting in any more 
		would be frowned on. British free climbing ethics are regarded by most 
		French climbers with high respect and the British have on the whole a 
		&quot;hard&quot; reputation. This is doubtless because they are not used 
		to &quot;les clogs&quot; which seem to them to be difficult to place and 
		unreliable. It is only beginning to be realised that these are precisely 
		the advantages that the nut has over the peg as well as providing obviously 
		greater possibilities for free climbing. The idea of not using a nut for 
		aid, however, is for the average French climber outside the realms of 
		understanding; &quot;Mais, c’est du masochisme, non?&quot; </P>
	  <P>Climbing 
		perhaps more than most sports develops tightly-knit groups and by extension 
		has become at times a peculiarly nationality-conscious activity The striking 
		successes of the English and French expeditions to Annapurna and Makalu, 
		compared with the foundering of the Everest experiences, have highlighted 
		and provided immediate arguments for such an attitude. It seems that it 
		is less in an atmosphere of optimism and logistics than on the level of 
		individuals and small groups that international understanding within mountaineering 
		is likely to flourish. Certainly climbing has much to gain in terms of 
		wider knowledge of techniques and areas through for example wider distribution 
		and perhaps translation of climbing journals. However, perhaps more now 
		than in recent years, with a greater individualism re-emerging in climbing 
		personal contact and discussion between individuals or groups of different 
		nationality may also provide new dimensions in attitudes and thinking 
		about values and ethics within the sport. </P>
