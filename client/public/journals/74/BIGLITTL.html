	  <P>IF you were 
		standing next to me and you felt like looking up, you would see Paul A 
		about 30 ft. higher, No, that’s not strictly correct, what you would see 
		is Paul’s old cagoule, Rog’s sit-harness made from a car seat belt, Tony’s 
		peg hammer swinging in the wind, Mike’s metal etriers and Carl’s rope. 
		About the only thing new with Paul are his boots. If you look carefully, 
		you can see that the yellow vibram sticker is still quite distinct. That 
		just about sums us up – a mixture of old equipment bought for a different 
		climate and a bit of new gear. </P>
	  <P>Now look 
		below you. </P>
	  <P>Impressive, 
		isn’t it? No, it’s not as much as that; it’s only about 600 ft. to the 
		hanging glacier. Over there you can see the box tent, a tiny orange rectangle 
		near the foot of the rock. It looks pretty good from here, doesn’t it? 
		Christ, who’d have thought that cubic horror, full of rime on the ceiling 
		and spindrift on the floor, could look good? But it does; home sweet freezing 
		home. </P>
	  <P>A rumble 
		behind makes me turn around – here comes .html one. I look up; yea, 
		Paul’s seen it too because he’s bracing himself with both hands. A minute 
		later it’s quieter again and we start retrieving the vertical. The snow 
		that’s falling is wet, so it doesn’t drift down the face – it makes life 
		a little more pleasant. If only my feet would thaw out a bit. How are 
		yours? Hmm, well despite what the old timers did, I think you’d be bloody 
		daft to take them off. Better just kick the rock, Not too hard though, 
		you can never tell with these pegs. </P>
	  <P>Well, I 
		suppose you are saying to yourself that I don’t have to be hanging in 
		ladders half way up the Sword in Patagonia if I don’t want to be, and 
		I guess you’re right. But despite that, it’s a pretty good feeling, Paul 
		F and Mike had two days’ siege on it, then Tony and Rog, and now it’s 
		Paul A’s and my turn. The traditional wind is blowing and the traditional 
		snow is falling, but the rock is granite, the cracks sharp, and the view 
		mind-blasting. Three days to establish the high camp (the slabs needed 
		quite a bit of fixed rope) and now it’s the big time. I wouldn’t like 
		to grade the route – in good weather we could have climbed more of it 
		free. As it was, it was about half-half, with free pitches never above 
		V.S. Who wants to be a dead tiger? The rest was cold A2. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Suddenly 
		last summer&quot; told you all about the area – across the valley, looking 
		straight into the wind, you can see the Cathedral. To the left is the 
		Fortress; behind, the Paine Grande. We’re in good company. The Paine Towers 
		will be visible when we reach the summit ridge. In the meanwhile, there’s 
		some climbing to be done. Paul’s finished the pitch and we’re trying to 
		work out which rope I’m going to prussik up. No, not the blue, it’s all 
		fluffy. That’s the trouble, you see; all the fixed ropes are old 9 mm, 
		kernmantles which friends have given us. What friend ever gave you a recent 
		rope? But short of the M.E.F. or R.G.S., who’s got the money for 3,000 
		ft. of line? So we use old 9 mm. Who says God is dead? He’s alive and 
		looking after climbers in Patagonia. </P>
	  <P>I’d better 
		tell you about the North Horn as well – L.G.P, of the valley, we all thought. 
		The Czechs hadn’t even got off the ground in ’68 they said. I’m not surprised, 
		they were using pegs made from railway line, judging from what we found. 
		They must have spent most of their time trying to prevent their high camp 
		from being blown away. We weren’t so lucky. What sort of wind breaks eight 
		polypropylene guy lines and removes without trace a box tent with 100 
		lb. of rock ballast in it? Like I said, God is alive... </P>
	  <P>The North 
		Horn. Only took us five days (two-and-a-half days of climbing really) 
		as against eight on the Sword. But good rock, and a fantastic finishing 
		pitch. Trouble was Mike only had three bongs wide enough for it. But we 
		all got up, same as the Sword, except here we were all together as one 
		big happy circus, The days are long. 6 a.m, till 11 p.m., so 7 p.m. is 
		still early to reach the top. It gave us time to strip the route as we 
		did on the Sword. Only this time, we even swopped the abseil pegs for 
		soft metal ones. Total cost: £2.40 for 1,000 ft of V.S. and A2. </P>
	  <P>Just as 
		well we saved the ropes. The river came down in flood and it took two 
		days to cross 50 yards of water and tumbling ice blocks. If we’d had the 
		whisky to go with it... but it was a bit late for New Year anyway. </P>
	  <P>That’s about 
		all there was to it, besides a third of a route (1,450 ft) up the east 
		face of the Central Tower of Paine, and no food, and Tony being blown 
		through the air with his pack on. There’s plenty more still waiting to 
		be done – the Mummer, the east face of the Cathedral (a fantastic line), 
		not to mention Kamikazi Face on the east side of the Paine Grande. All 
		you need are three avalanche buckets, two months and a big little expedition. 
		</P>
