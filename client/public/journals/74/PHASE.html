	  <P>IT�S a strange 
		feeling when it happens, in fact there�s not much stranger, First one 
		seems rather in control, in a normal state of mind you might say. One�s 
		body is busying itself about various things. Some are contributing to 
		moving it up a piece of rock. No hurry, of course, there is a clear distribution 
		of labour. Climbing a rock may stimulate certain primitive urges, but 
		these have become somewhat suppressed of late and for the most part their 
		appeasement is something of a chore the rest of the mind goes through 
		from time to time. But calculations have to be made � there are little 
		things like safety to consider. So a sum is performed and suddenly a part 
		of my mind knows, and, hanging on my arms, I turn and grin, incongrously, 
		at my second and say: &quot;I�m coming off.&quot; </P>
	  <P>So what 
		should I do? Jump? And while I am thinking these things and while the 
		strength drains from my arms like water, my mind changes state. </P>
	  <P>Then the 
		time for decision is past, for I am climbing down and across � ten feet 
		to the runner � and though thoughts still circle on the surface they have 
		no effect, for my mind has fragmented and while time stands still, miracles 
		are performed. </P>
	  <P>I must be 
		off now! But tiny holds are jugs and shattered fingers tempered steel. 
		Reach down for the next hole, a side pull. Feet move with precision where 
		before they searched in vain, I stand aside for a while and watch as seconds 
		stretch to centuries and my small tired body climbs its way to safety; 
		and I wait for the inevitability when the rock blurs upwards into space 
		and this new world becomes the old, or ends. </P>
	  <P>The picture 
		dims as the mind concentrates towards the distant runner. The rock moves 
		sluggishly in jerks and bounds, and fingers grab and slowly open out I 
		reach again, step down, feet slide and stop, then fingers clutch a little 
		hold and fumble slowly as time expands and the picture crystallises, the 
		blurred edges moving inwards towards enormous fingertips braced trembling 
		on the finely sculptured grey knobble with patches of lichen scraped by 
		newly broken nails, and the mind goes numb, the first joints become fuzzy 
		as in each new instant of time they open out .html fraction and move 
		closer and closer to the edge of reality. I reach down again, the rope 
		hauls upwards at my waist, sliding through the runners a bit and I stop 
		swinging and look down, grinning sheepishly, but my second looks somewhat 
		strangled so I clip a sling into a nearby runner and stand in it. </P>
	  <P>So the change 
		has passed, The mind is back in phase with normality and relaxes for a 
		while, gently easing away the effects of being driven to its limit. The 
		chemicals coursing through the bloodstream are gradually dissipated and 
		from the brain the memories of fear and desperation are erased until only 
		happiness and elation remain � after effects of one of the two most powerful 
		emotions it is possible to experience. For danger is both the antithesis 
		and the dual of sex. Both are primal instincts, bred into us through survival. 
		Both in their climaxes involve the totality of mind and body. Yet they 
		start at opposite ends of the scale of human motivation. While we seek 
		the one we avoid the other � the duality corresponds to that between life 
		and death. It is only by experiencing both ends of the scale that one 
		proves that one is what one claims to be � a being capable of survival, 
		Only at these extremes are the full forces of the body combined to a single 
		uniquely important end. If one never samples the threat of death and one�s 
		mind never changes from the dispersed operation of normal life there remains 
		a big question mark, and the basic and most principal capabilities of 
		the mind are never tested. </P>
