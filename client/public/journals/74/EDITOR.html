	  <P>THIS year 
		has seen a rather distressing but inevitable break with tradition – the 
		demise of the annual journal. In part this was due to an unfortunate accident 
		to last year’s Journal Editor at a rather critical time for its production, 
		But .html reason, and one that will become more serious in the future, 
		is the financial position. Costs inevitably rise and this not only affects 
		production but it also means that advertisers are reluctant to make the 
		C.U.M.C. journal part of their budget. To those advertisers who do appear 
		within we are most grateful, and as always we extend our thanks to the 
		printers, Elphicks, who have been patient through a year of. indecision. 
		</P>
	  <P>This year 
		we have, therefore, two years’ revenue and so have been able to include 
		a few extra photographs as well as articles covering two years of club 
		activity, Whether future journals will cover two years depends on many 
		factors, but it seems a pity to drop the yearly journal. Perhaps a change 
		of format is required. </P>
	  <P>Now to less 
		weighty matters – that of club membership, which seems to be taking the 
		healthy upward turn; from about 100 in ’72/73 to over 120 this year. In 
		part this may be due to the successful introduction of a discount three 
		year membership Next year should tell us more. </P>
	  <P>The annual 
		dinner last year was held in Derbyshire for a change. A riotous time was 
		had by all, entertainment being provided by Alsatians and Solicitors. 
		Coupled with a weekend’s climbing it made for a successful time; we shall, 
		however, not be returning to Derbyshire for this year’s dinner, which 
		is due to be held in Cambridge – just too late for this editorial. </P>
	  <P>Climbing 
		in the club has seen a change over the past two years with the departure 
		of the two leading lights, Alan Rouse and Mick Geddes; however, the club 
		seems to be adjusting and is regaining its former momentum with the influx 
		of potential talent. </P>
	  <P>Bar leaving 
		many people at the Roaches and a breakdown on the A1, the meets secretary 
		has been coping well in the face of the petrol crisis and the meets are 
		becoming more adventurous, with more weekends away from Cambridge. Further 
		information on climbing in the club is contained in the climbing notes. 
		</P>
	  <P>Over the 
		past two years we have had a full and varied lecture programme – a glance 
		at the list will confirm this – but almost invariably these are poorly 
		attended, especially for the lesser known speakers who are no less interesting. 
		This seems a pity when one considers that this is one of the major items 
		of the club budget and a lot more than many other clubs provide. So get 
		along there on Fridays, you lazy sods! </P>
