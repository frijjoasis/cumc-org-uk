	  <P>I SUPPOSE 
		the first question is &quot;How did a nice convent school- girl like me 
		become involved with a load of bums like C.U.M.C.? Well after the frustrations 
		of such an upbringing, I suppose it is quite understandable, but the initiation 
		test was quite an &quot;accident&quot;, It all happened at a piss-up in 
		a friend’s room – some great lout on crutches made a quick dash for the 
		loo, carefully placing his crutch (plus whole weight) on my foot. He thus 
		became the only Jake-the-peg to break three feet. </P>
	  <P>For some 
		unaccountable reason I ended up going out with the lout, who apparently 
		considered himself a climber. Unfortunately (for whom I am not quite sure) 
		climbing was out until the Lent term, due to collapsed limbs, when our 
		relationship came down to the nitty-gritty – &quot;either you come climbing 
		with me or amuse yourself all Sunday&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I thought, 
		&quot;anything for a laugh,&quot; and went along </P>
	  <P>I must admit 
		that I did enjoy my first visit to Stanage! The petrol-fumed minibus nearly 
		caused me to chunder mutilated baked-beans into the crash hat I was hugging 
		on my lap, which caused a bit of a stir. After that they let me sit in 
		the front, so perhaps it was worth the fuss. On arriving we discovered 
		that the frozen north really did exist and I looked around expecting to 
		see Eskimo Nell standing there. However, I was not to be saved by any 
		such apparition, and was forced to lug a great heavy rope up to the crag. 
		The rest of the day I spent freezing, but it was all too novel for me 
		to learn my lesson. </P>
	  <P>The next 
		thing I knew was the C.U.M.C. dinner – £3.50 to have your idolised president 
		throw brussel sprouts at you – no chance. A snowy night spent in a cold 
		barn full of drunken, snoring hooligans – &quot;Never again" I thought. 
		</P>
	  <P>But after 
		a few weeks when the memory had deadened a bit, I was persuaded that a 
		long weekend in Derbyshire was just what I needed to finish off a perfect 
		term. &quot;Perfect term&quot;, I thought, but did not hasten to question 
		the English. Seven hours to hitch to Stoney Middleton; still the weather 
		was fine and the tent quickly put up. Time for a quick drink down the 
		pub before retiring – which leads to the main problem encountered by women 
		climbers. By 9 a.m. in the morning I was dying to go to the loo – threw 
		on a couple of extra jumpers (I had slept in jeans and T-shirt due to 
		the cold), Well, it was dark when we arrived and how was I to know that 
		the quarry opposite worked on a Saturday. I tore down to Eric’s and hammered 
		on the door of the ladies &quot;loo". The string fastening to the door 
		snapped and I found myself apologising to a very red-faced old lady, who 
		turned nut to be a lorry driver, </P>
	  <P>Relieved 
		at last, I wandered back to awaken the snoring mass stretched across the 
		tent. My first real climbing was attempted that weekend, and I was getting 
		on quite well. The weather was great and we wandered over to Froggatt 
		and Millstone Edge. I was feeling quite pleased with myself until my &quot;mentor&quot; 
		asked me whether I was going to get down to some graded routes now that 
		I had sussed out the boulder problems. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Right, 
		I’ll show him,&quot; I thought, mustering up all hidden feelings for Women’s 
		Lib. The chance came when I was honoured with a four day visit before 
		a two week climbing trip to Aviemore. &quot;Fancy a trip to my local crag?&quot; 
		I asked nonchalantly. So off to Avon Gorge we went. You know it doesn’t 
		look that high when you’re driving past in the car. Putting on an air 
		of calm confidence, I fumbled to tie the rope around my waist. &quot;It’s 
		all right, I remember how to tie it – just don’t rush me.&quot; Half an 
		hour later – &quot;It wasn’t my fault, it was the bunny going the wrong 
		way round the loop.&quot; Off goes the leader up the first pitch, while 
		I stand panic stricken at the foot, reminding myself that it was only 
		a &quot;Diff.&quot; – a walk rather than a climb, really. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Are 
		you bloody well coming up or not?&quot; was the rude awakening I received 
		from my daydream. &quot;Climbing,&quot; I stuttered back. &quot;Well, 
		if you can call it that,&quot; I thought to myself. The thing that put 
		me off most about the first pitch was this little five year old kid who 
		kept clambering up next to me and telling me where the next foot-hold 
		was. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Piss 
		off,&quot; I thought to myself, but mustering up all my teachers training, 
		quietly told him to go back down because his mother was probably looking 
		for him. A worried face greeted me as I joined my partner. &quot;It’s 
		alright,&quot; I lied, &quot;that little kid was getting into a bit of 
		trouble and I had to see him down again&quot; – ever felt a heel. Still 
		the face looked worried. &quot;You can’t remember where the route goes 
		next, can you?&quot; it said. I didn’t really panic – I felt more like 
		laughing actually – shock I think the word is. &quot;Does that mean we 
		will have to go back down?&quot; I brightened. &quot;Oh no, we’ll find 
		a way up,&quot; was the confident reply. </P>
	  <P>My heart 
		sank again as I was left to my own thoughts. I searched in my pockets 
		for a scrap of paper and pencil stub to write my last request – &quot;Cremate 
		the pulped up mess and scatter the ashes over Arms Park.&quot; What Welsh 
		girl could ask for more? The day had been quite fine but now clouds were 
		starting to gather and it was cold. I was glad to be climbing again. By 
		now it had started to rain and several other parties had abseiled off. 
		Unfortunately I had a gap in my training – I had never learnt this effective 
		method of descending. I was just contemplating the inefficiency of my 
		teacher when I felt the world slipping from under my feet, and the rope 
		around my waist crack against my spine. </P>
	  <P>&quot;You 
		alright,&quot; said the voice from above. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Fine,&quot; 
		I answered, clinging onto the rock-face by my finger-nails. It took six 
		more attempts and a very tight rope to complete the move. The rock had 
		a stream running down it by this time and the rubber soles of my plimsols 
		were slippery from clearing away the vegetation (well, that’s my excuse 
		anyway). </P>
	  <P>As we stood 
		on Lunchtime Ledge trying to decide whether I should start lessons in 
		abseiling or risk my neck climbing the rest of this saturated crag, we 
		were suddenly confronted with the ghost like head of. .html human, peering 
		over the other side of the ledge. </P>
	  <P>&quot;It’s 
		the mountain rescue people,&quot; I said confidently, but was met by a 
		look of disdain that indicated I had said something wrong. Five other 
		heads, attached to five even stranger bodies, followed in quick succession 
		– a bit like a Keystone Cops movie, in fact. We stood and eyed them from 
		one side of the ledge, while they did the same from the other. At last 
		my companion approached the leader of the little band, a bloke of about 
		forty who looked as if be knew every crag in Britain. </P>
	  <P>&quot;You 
		know the easy way up?&quot; he asked. The man grunted. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Mind 
		if we join you?&quot; he asked hesitantly. Again a grunt. We turned to 
		collect our rope and gear. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Hey, 
		you the two who just climbed that Hard V.S.?&quot; said a voice from behind. 
		My partner froze as he saw the words sinking into my small share of grey 
		matter. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Hard 
		V.S.&quot; I exploded. &quot;You told me it was a Diff.&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Well, 
		it was until I got lost,&quot; was the sheepish reply. I was too stunned 
		to answer and anyway the others had started climbing – the rain was teeming 
		down but it was anger that blinded me to everything else except the figure 
		clambering above. He offered a hand to me as I reached the top, but I 
		would rather have jumped off rather than take it. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Just 
		don’t talk to me,&quot; I said through gritted teeth, as I stalked past 
		him. </P>
	  <P>It’s been 
		a long time now since I’ve been asked to go climbing and I have settled 
		down to a steady routine of packing sandwiches for one only on a Saturday 
		night, dreaming of the peaceful Sunday stretching before me. I was quite 
		safe (so I thought) until last week when I was informed that a super three 
		week holiday was all planned out for us during the summer vac. Yes, climbing, 
		in the Ardennes; who could ask for more?!! </P>
