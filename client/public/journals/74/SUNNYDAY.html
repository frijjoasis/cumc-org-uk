	  <P>JUST before 
		seven in the morning and the Scottish midwinter darkness was still complete. 
		Inside the C.I.C, hut it was darker still as I lay thinking over the last 
		few days. First it had been rain, and warm with last week�s reported good 
		conditions literally melting away. We had been pessimistic as we trudged 
		up the two and a half miles of boggy track from the distillery, our sacks 
		of goodies reducing us to a steady mile an hour. The next day from sheer 
		boredom we had gone for a walk in the rain. We returned happier: although 
		the thaw had taken the snow off most of the ridges and buttresses, there 
		was a lot of firm old snow in the gullies. So to find out about snow and 
		ice we assaulted these and had a good day. Then the rain had stopped and 
		the nights had become even colder, so we had been a bit more ambitious. 
		This was to be our last day and we must leave for Fort William in the 
		evening but last night had promised a good day so we intended to do the 
		Tower Ridge. There would not be overmuch snow on it but we thought that 
		frozen meltwater on the rocks could be time-consuming so we planned to 
		be off at eight. </P>
	  <P>Soon after 
		seven somebody�s alarm clock unwound at the far end of the hut, I lay 
		there thinking: if I wait there a bit longer someone else will get up 
		and put a light on and a brew. Soon I can�t delay any longer. So I find 
		some clothes and then there is a kettle boiling and porage making. A relieving 
		trip outside reveals a view of cold, clear stars, framed by the black 
		and white flecked cliffs of Coire na Ciste. All looks good but it is cold 
		out there so I am soon inside again telling Mike the good news and stuffing 
		porage down unwilling throat and gear down unwilling sack. </P>
	  <P>For once 
		we are even on time as we stumble out into the half-light. Below us the 
		glen of the Allt a�Mhuillin is truncated: at fifteen hundred feet it stops 
		short where a sea of cotton-wool cloud breaks noiselessly on the grassy 
		shore. Beyond the hills at the head of Glen Garry rise like little islands: 
		their lower slopes snow-white, the uppers rose-red in the dawn. </P>
	  <P>We slowly 
		wander up the valley towards the Douglas Boulder � the two thousand feet 
		of ridge all visible against a blue-black sky and the impressiveness grows 
		on us, so a halt has to be made. The snow is really frozen hard so, soon 
		after, .html is necessary to engage crampons. Thus equipped we move 
		fast along the snow slopes on the eastern edge of Coire na Ciste to the 
		foot of the Douglas Gap West Gully. It is getting lighter all the time 
		and as we rise higher more and more peaks come into view, archipelagos 
		in the grey sea. We keep stopping, shutters clicking in all directions. 
		The snow in the gully is not complete; there are three rocky steps but 
		on the whole the hard crampon-inviting surface makes for fast progress 
		to the Douglas Gap, which is reached at a quarter to nine. </P>
	  <P>From here 
		an easy chimney leads up sixty feet or so onto the ridge proper. There 
		is hardly any snow on the rocks, just icy patches to keep the concentration 
		going, so crampons are relegated to rucksacks. The chimney is quite steep 
		and fitted with huge flat holds, but my bulging sack does its best to 
		convince me that I will fall off backwards, so I am quite glad to emerge 
		onto the ridge itself. The first bit is level and wide, you could walk 
		along it with your hands in your. pockets, but soon the route moves out 
		right along a snowy shelf towards Coire na Ciste. The snow is quite hard 
		but a narrow rocky section at the bottom is reasonable � only icy, and 
		I am nearly convinced I should have left my crampons on. It is soon over 
		though, and we move back to the top of. the ridge by scrambling over rocks 
		which are surprisingly free from ice. </P>
	  <P>It is level 
		again now � though narrower and occasionally there are short stretches 
		of hard snow where the wind has sculpted the crest to a sort of knife 
		edge. Really beautiful, but how do you tackle them with no crampons � 
		a step kicking hand traverse but boots don�t really bite � or a cheval, 
		but think of that cold, cold snow between your legs � eventually it is 
		a teetering tight rope walk and not too hard really &quot;Two nicks... 
		are met here&quot;, but I am the only one, &quot;on the left of the second 
		is the top of the Great Chimney&quot;; I look down it and am impressed; 
		consult the guide book to find it is Grade IV. </P>
	  <P>&quot;150 
		feet beyond this second cleft is the little tower... the route is by the 
		left edge.&quot; We just wander on up, trying to go for the rocky bits 
		rather than the snowy ones. At the top we call a halt for photographs, 
		to look around and study the guidebook. Above us is the Great Tower, four 
		thousand feet up the mountain and a hundred and fifty feet high. We are 
		soon at its foot and looking at the Eastern Traverse. A thin band of high 
		angle snow leads out left � above is the east side of the tower, almost 
		vertical and encrusted with snow where it falls back below this angle. 
		</P>
	  <P>The snow 
		is hard so we stop to put on our crampons and, seeing two pegs peeping 
		out of a crack in the rock, put on the rope as a gesture to the impressive 
		drop � four hundred feet, seemingly vertically, between the crampons of 
		the traversing climber and the floor of Observatory Gully. Mike belays 
		to the pegs and I move out left � easy now but the next bit looks harder. 
		I have to move down and cross a shallow groove. I think about a runner 
		but it is not worth putting in a peg and perhaps it is not that hard really, 
		so on I go and it really isn�t, so I stop to pose for a photo and then 
		reciprocate. Round the corner now and up; &quot;How much rope left?&quot;; 
		&quot;Twenty feet.&quot; Christ! I don�t make a habit of running out a 
		hundred and thirty feet of single nine mil; still, better start looking 
		for a belay. Some flakes above me look inviting, so I mantleshelf onto 
		a rock ledge, crampon points sparking on the icy rock � no joy though, 
		they are all loose, but ten feet away is a boulder sticking out of a snowfield. 
		I get there and it seems secure so I drop a tape over it and bury a deadman 
		for good measure, then I sit on the boulder to hold it in and take in 
		the remaining five feet of rope. </P>
	  <P>I have a 
		superb view down into Observatory Gully, and as Mike comes up I watch 
		N and Z at the start of Good Friday climb. They seem to be having a bit 
		of trouble as ropes and buckets abound on their walk up. An attempt at 
		shouted conversation reveals the superb echoing abilities of this part 
		of the gully but soon degenerates to insults. Then my attention is drawn 
		to Mike who has nearly finished the pitch and soon leads on through to 
		the top of the tower in .html rope�s length, I follow � finding it quite 
		steep but soon getting the hang of using small rock holds with crampon 
		points. </P>
	  <P>The view 
		from the top of the tower is really scenic so we get some more pictures 
		before moving on to the supposed sting in the tail � the Tower Gap. A 
		hundred feet of level ridge leads me to the near edge of it, Someone, 
		I think, described it in a recent journal as the karate chop of an enraged 
		Norse deity � I can�t think of a better description. Six or seven feet 
		across and some ten or fifteen feet deep, its sides are vertical to north 
		and south, while to the east steep mixed ground drops away into tower 
		gully and to the west is a bird�s eye view of Glover�s Chimney (now immortalised 
		on the front cover of Wilson�s weekly). It looks a fine route and plans 
		for the next visit are already hatching. Anyway, a tape over a large block 
		spurs me on to scramble down into the cleft and then I set about getting 
		out again. It isn�t really very hard and so I soon bounce back up out 
		of my hole and start rabbitting about for a belay. A large loose flake 
		comes to light and so Mike gets the go ahead, finding if anything even 
		less difficulty than I had done. The rope is soon coiled away in a sack 
		and we assault the final steep ice and snow leading to the summit. </P>
	  <P>We sit down 
		and appreciate the eleven o�clock sunlight on the roof of Scotland � below 
		us the higher hills sail like ships of the line through the cloudy sea. 
		Away to the west are the Cuillins � with many memories of summer, and 
		just the tip of Rhum. To the south, beyond the Mamores, Bidean and Cruachan 
		dominate; away to the east is conical Schehallion, to north-east the bulk 
		of the Cairngorms with many more memories, and northwards, north-westwards, 
		the hills of Inverness and Ross, Mam Sodhail and the Sisters I particularly 
		recognise. </P>
	  <P>The unexpected 
		earliness leads to thought of .html climb and Three Gully Buttress is 
		decided on in view of enthusiastic reports from other Cambridge members 
		the previous day. Quickly we walk through the winter sunlight towards 
		number four gully. At the top of two gully a Scotsman from the hut is 
		just overcoming the cornice so we watch and then go on. </P>
	  <P>Soon we 
		are looking across the steep snow slopes towards three gully and its buttress. 
		Two are already on it though the leader seems to have finished the first 
		pitch. Quickly cramponning across we arrive and start uncoiling the rope. 
		The leader still hasn�t found a belay so we talk and sort gear, then I 
		am off up the ice pitch � seems very straight-forward but nice with it 
		and I am soon banging in a leeper and tying it off for a belay along with 
		a frozen deadman. Mike is soon there and leads on up; then it�s onwards 
		and upwards leapfrogging up a hundred and fifty feet at a time, except 
		for a bit of yoyoing after runaway pegs, and in four more rope lengths 
		we are back in the summit sunlight. Quick speed comparisons lead us to 
		conclude that either we are better than we thought or others are more 
		festerous. </P>
	  <P>Once again 
		the talk is of .html route and North Gully is mooted but a sight of 
		the cornice above and a closer acquaintance with the almost bare lower 
		section reveals hidden festering abilities and a taste for brews and bacon 
		butties in the hut. </P>
	  <P>As darkness 
		falls four burdened glow-worms leave the hut in quest of the ale and chips 
		of Fort William. Two hours later these thoughts are realised in the Jacobite, 
		and while two of us get thrashed at arrows by the local Mountain Rescue 
		the others just drink and think of how much there is for the next visit. 
		</P>
