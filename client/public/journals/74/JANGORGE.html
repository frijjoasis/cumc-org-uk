	  <P>AN article 
		for the journal? O.K. Now what do I write about? A good route, now what 
		have I done? Nowt. Oh well, there�s always Avon this Sunday. What can 
		I do there? Malpractice sounds good enough (depending on which guide you 
		use). Now what do the other guys think of it? </P>
	  <P>Neil: &quot;Hard.&quot; 
		</P>
	  <P>Z: &quot;Waste 
		of time.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Oh well, 
		it was a nice thought. </P>
	  <P>M.A.P.: 
		&quot;I found it really gripping, but there�s a peg you can use on the 
		crux.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Well, I 
		might as well give it a burl. </P>
	  <P>Sunday comes 
		and figures loom out of the darkness to colleet at the Senate House. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Morning 
		Glebe.&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Morning 
		all.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Grumbled 
		greetings exchanged, everybody settles on their sacks to await the arrival 
		of the van. A crash of gears echoing up King�s Parade herald its approach. 
		</P>
	  <P>The monotonous 
		four-hour cross-country drive is punctuated only by the occasional scream 
		from the mass of cramped, contorted bodies in the rear. As we pile into 
		the cafe at Oxford for a late breakie, the Gog Magog representative indulges 
		in one of the Club�s oral activities. Still, it was pretty stuffy in there. 
		</P>
	  <P>Climbers, 
		tourists and dogs alike jump out of the way as the van grinds into the 
		Gorge car park. A quick brew and then, being sufficiently gripped, we 
		got Mike to show us the beginning of the route. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Where�s 
		it go?&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Up 
		there, there, across there and then up there, just follow the spikes.&quot; 
		</P>
	  <P>An awkward 
		mantleshelf to start leads to the bottom of a smooth slab. It looks like 
		it goes left here. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Hey, 
		Glebe, you should have gone straight up&quot; � Neil was next to us on 
		Malwhatsit. A look round the corner reveals a ledge system leading to 
		the two spikes. </P>
	  <P>&quot;It�s 
		O.K., I think this is the alternative start.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Belaying 
		with the spikes between your legs certainly gives you a nervous sweat. 
		However, no fear, Roj gets up the pitch O.K. and positions are exchanged. 
		Where now? A climb up the rib on the right gives a couple of runners. 
		A shout comes from below: &quot;I can see the peg five feet above the 
		triangular overhang.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Oh hell 
		that looks a wee bit committing. A couple of trial prances then here it 
		goes. The flake reveals itself � a beautiful layback � a stupendous layback 
		and there you are � footholds as well � what more could you ask for? </P>
	  <P>The peg 
		is threaded and from below comes a muffled threat. Sitting astride the 
		spikes, Roj is looking a trifle worried about his future married life. 
		A couple of months of climbing certainly shows itself, the arms are beginning 
		to feel a bit knackered. </P>
	  <P>Let�s see 
		what is above the peg � a quick foot change and a move up shows good holds, 
		but in the wrong position. A rapid reversal and then a clip onto the peg 
		for a rest. There go the ethics. Now if the left foot goes on that wee 
		hold and the right foot goes up... </P>
	  <P>&quot;Here 
		goes Roj.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Unclip and 
		up we go. Great, huge jugs all the way up � now what are you shaking for? 
		A short rest and then an unsuccessful cowboy act to get a forward rope 
		onto the next phallic spike. A quick swing down, a runner on the spike 
		and straight across the slab to the tree belay. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Right, 
		Roj, your turn.&quot; </P>
	  <P>He climbs 
		up, pulling out the many runners. A few minutes rest at the crux and up 
		he comes. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Good, 
		wasn�t it?&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Great, 
		apart from your singing.&quot; </P>
	  <P>The steep 
		groove above goes, easier, then up to belay off the park railings. Hundreds 
		of grockles abound and there�s even a Mister Softee. Roj appears, the 
		belay is unclipped, and then a race for the first ice cream. </P>
	  <P>A slide 
		down the muddy path and then brews and butties in the car park, beans 
		and chips on the motorway and plenty of tubes at the &quot;Whale&quot;. 
		Now what about next year�s journal? </P>
