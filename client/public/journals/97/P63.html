<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">The art of falling according to Pete...</H2>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">(Pete Kirkham)</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since I started climbing, falling off has been an integral part of the 
sport. Partly this could be blamed on the fact that I started leading on 
about my eighth route, with virtually no experience at all. For the 
record I would not recommend this to .html novice. Keen to improve 
quickly Stu seemed to be a good source of information on leading, and in 
the pub one night I asked for his advice. Basically he said that learning 
to place good pro which will hold is essential (pretty obvious) and that 
there were two ways of going about it:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><OL TYPE=1>
<LI>Climb lots of easy routes you know you can do and get proficient at 
placing gear.
<LI>Climb above yourself so that you fall onto your gear (at low levels) 
and learn exactly what will hold and what won't. This is by far the 
quicker but more dangerous option.
</OL>

 <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Somehow I don't think he expected me to take the latter option, as when I
came back after the summer having taken several falls Stu just couldn't
understand why I had taken that many falls. Stu at this point boasted that
he had only ever taken three leader falls. Obviously I was doing something
wrong. However during the course of term, it was discovered that Stu had
actually taken more than three falls on his rope, and silenced the critics
with this e-mail... 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regards to my earlier e-mail in which I claim to have taken "lots of
falls" on this rope, despite earlier claims to having only ever taking
three leader falls, I was of course referring to falls sport climbing,
which as everyone knows don't count (although some of were quite big ;that
70-footer from the crux of Supercool at gordale, well I filled me pants at
that one.) The point being that my only trad leader falls (not counting
resting on gear are:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><OL TYPE=1>
<LI>From crux of The Crack VS 4b (aah incompetence, it comes to all of us)
<LI>All our Yesterdays, Almscliffe E5 6b (it was wet)
<LI>Prospective new route Almscliffe (A hold broke (honest!) - actually 
  I just fell off this one, no excuse) 
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is because I am too scared to climb anything hard above my own gear,
whilst actually falling on it breaks me out in a rash, did you know that
when I reached the top of mark of the beast (sport route, sorry) to find
there was no abseil chain and I would have to jump onto my last bolt a
full ooh three feet below me , I hung on the final holds for two minutes
until Random Factor Stark pulled me off, squealing as I went. So you see
(last commment directed at pete only) real climbers don't fall, we get
scared and back off. 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, before I get a reputation as reckless I thought I would quickly 
list my falls:
<OL TYPE=1><LI>Sin VS 4c at Stoney Middleton (No-one told me that limestone routes 
here were hard...)
<LI>Random VS in Clywd, North Wales (It was raining when the huge block I 
was holding onto and had my only piece of gear behind decided to detach 
itself from the cliff. Doh! I landed on Sharkie's head thus saving myself 
from a potentially dangerous ground fall. Thanks Simon!)
<LI>Savage Cabbage 19. A natural route in Sydney. (My scariest fall to 
date. Topping out my foot blew off a smear. 1m down to gear, except that 
the nuts decide to explode the soft sandstone around them and its .html 
3m to go. Shit!) 
<LI>Embankment 3 E1 5b, Millstone Edge. (This was onto a peg about 2m 
below me. Inexperience was to blame here.)
<LI>Flying Buttress Direct HVS 5b, Stanage (Don't ever pre clip pro into 
your rope before you place it or you might find yourself clove hitching 
yourself to the route, dangling off one arm pulling the rope up with the 
other and thinking, oh shit what now, as you plummet very much gravity 
assisted back down. Don't ask how I only came away with two minor rope 
burns after ripping two pieces and landing onto the slab below with only 
one piece of gear left in the route.) 
<LI>Z Climb Eliminate HVS 5b, Almscliff (I'd done the crux, but was too 
tired and sort of let go. Bouldering all day is not a good plan if you 
want to climb routes later on!)
</OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Stu's not counting sport routes or hangdogging then neither am I. So 
there...<BR>
At the end of all that, what have I learnt that could act as advice for 
other novice climbers in their first year? With regards to falling, 
natural pro is always dodgy and even what you might consider bomber may 
not always be. However, the more you fall, the less it worries you. I 
find that being above my gear on a hard crux move is less scary than it 
used to be. This means that you can concentrate more clearly on the moves 
at hand. At the end of the day though there is one simple rule. Don't 
fall. Learn to downclimb to minimise any fall you might take. Pushing 
yourself on hard routes is not a bad thing to do, but best done as a 
second to start with, or on lead when you know you can place pro well. If 
a route has dodgy pro, there is no shame in top-roping it first. Not 
everything has to be done on-sight (although it's nice.) Otherwise stick 
to routes you know you should be able to climb well.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> As for me, I'm going to stick to HVS/VS climbs with solid pro until I've 
learnt to climb properly. That way I shouldn't ever feel the need to fall 
off anymore! 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> Clamber hard, Plunge safe...
