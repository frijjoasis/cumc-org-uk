<P ALIGN="CENTER">The great lake in the moonlight<BR>
with the sewage only downstream<BR>
our pale limbs forgetting and remembering<BR> 
the ancestors in one motion.<BR>
And she says and will say again<BR>
that motion became a thousand<BR>
each more intricate than the next;<BR>
In time, in our memories, and in the ripples of that water<BR>
and in our ascent somehow you turned to rock within my core<BR>
Like the one I carry in sities to remember<BR>
that outsied that concrete and steel forest<BR>
there is a mountain waiting.<BR>
