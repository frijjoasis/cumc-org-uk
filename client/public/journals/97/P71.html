<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">The Rime of the Ancient Mountaineer</H2>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">(Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Matthew Brown)</H3>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">It is an Ancient Mountaineer,<BR>
And he stoppeth on of three.<BR>
'By thy long grey beard, and glitt'ring eye,<BR>
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Crag is dry, and friction good;<BR>
And I am next to climb.<BR>
Hold off! Unhand me grey-beard loon!<BR>
For now there ist no time.'

<P ALIGN="CENTER">He holds him with his glittering eye - <BR>
The climber he stood still.<BR>
And thus spake on that ancient man, <BR>
The bright eyed Mountaineer.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">He holds him with his skinny hand, <BR>
'There was a climb.' quoth he.<BR>
'A mountain high and line so true, <BR>
So beautious to see.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The rope was set, the camp was cleared,<BR>
Merrily did we climb<BR>
Above the 'shrund and onto rock<BR>
That stood the test of time.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The sun came up upon our left,<BR>
Out of the mist came he.<BR>
And we moved up on jam and crimp<BR>
O'er all the world to see.'

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The climber's route it was then pinched,<BR>
Yet he cannot chooes but hear.<BR>
And thus spake on that ancient man,<BR>
The bright eyed mountaineer.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Listen stranger! Storm and Wind<BR>
A Wind and Tempest strong!<BR>
For days and weeks it played us freaks -<BR>
Like chaff we were aloft.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Listen stranger, Mist and Snow,<BR>
And it grew wond'rous cold;<BR>
And ice was grown as hard as stone<BR>
And green as Emerauld.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Our axes blunt and crampons dull,<BR>
Did cast a dismal sheen.<BR>
Nor shapes of men, nor beasts we ken -<BR>
The ice was all between.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">At length we spied a narrow ridge,<BR>
Through out the mist it came.<BR>
With legs astride we moved up high<BR>
And hailed it in God's name.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">And from the summit could we see<BR>
Where Hea'en met Earth below.<BR>
Majestic beauty, wond'rous light<BR>
No mortal shall e'er know.'

<P ALIGN="CENTER">The mountaineer, whose eye is bright,<BR>
Whose beard is tangled locks<BR>
Is gone; And now the sport climber<BR>
Turns from the bolted rock.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">He went like one who hath been stunned,<BR>
A veil he has seen drawn.<BR>
A Mountaineer and wiser man<BR>
He rose the morrow morn.
