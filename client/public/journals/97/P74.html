<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">(Stu Littlefair)</H3>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">to the tune of Pinball Wizard by the Who</H2>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Now since I was a young boy, I've tried to climb on Strone,<BR>
But though I got a car last year, I've never really gone.<BR>
Its just the HEIGHT that scares me, you'll often hear me moan<BR>.
That anorexic little wierdo, sure climbs mean gritstone.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">He rocks-over like a demon, and crimps like a machine,<BR>
On anything under twenty feet, hes really rather keen.<BR>
But high up in the mountains, he's very seldom seen,<BR>
That anorexic little wierdo, sure climbs mean gritstone.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Chorus.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">He's a gritstone wizard, Staying very low.<BR>
Our gritstone wizards got real bad vertigo.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">We took him to the mountains, he didnt like the cold,<BR>
But near the ground at Stanage, he's often almost bold.<BR>
He doesnt want no Big Boots, but give him Tiny Holds,<BR>
That musclely little oddball, sure climbs mean gritstone.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Chorus.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">He's a gritstone wizard, and even though he should,<BR>
he won't be going climbing cos the friction is no good.
