<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Club membership rose massively again this year despite the weather's attempts to put everyone off in Michaelmas term.  Both newcomers' meets were a washout and even some of the hardened big-booters conceded a hasty retreat to Mile End and the F*****y.  Nevertheless, persistence paid off and much real rock was climbed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Roaches, a popular favourite with the Club, provided fun by way of <I>Chalkstorm</I> (E4, 5c) which Matt B. coolly soloed and Matt H. led (what the difference is, I'm not sure).  The same pair also did the classic <I>Elegy</I> (E2, 5c) and Stu and I did some 'cutting loose' on <I>The Sloth</I> (HVS, 5b).  Over on Millstone, Leyla and Yasmine fought their way up <I>Great Portland Street</I> (HVS, 5b) and <I>Bond Street</I> (HVS, 5a) while Dave and Bruno grunted up <I>Great North Road</I> (HVS, 5a).  Froggatt hosted some fine struggles including <I>Chequer's Buttress</I> (HVS, 5a); <I>Valkyrie</I> (HVS, 5a); <I>Three Pebble Slab</I> (E1, 5a) and <I>Trapeze Direct</I> (VS, 4c - which has seen the demise of several 'extreme' leaders!).  Limestone was not forgotten either and Amos, coming out of retirement, moosed his way up <I>Skylight</I> (VS, 4c) and <I>Highlight</I >(HVS, 5a) before making <I>Original Route</I> (HVS, 5a) look easy by comparison.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">North Wales provided its usual share of adventures and fine ascents including <I>Vector</I> (E2, 5c - Matt B. and Amos; Dave H. and Tom P.); Left Wall (E2, 5c - Amos and Leyla); <I>Right Wall</I> (E5, 6a - Jamie(from Edinburgh) and Doug); <I>Comes the Dervish</I> (E3, 5c - Leyla and Amos, and the two Matts - who 'worked' quite hard at it!) and <I>Cenotaph Corner</i> (E1, 5c - Me and Martin).  Milage was also had on a very wet <I>Grooved Arete</I> (HVD - Dave, Ian, Roz and Pete) as well as the slippery Idwal Slabs, where Yasmine, Ben and Lisa did <I>Tennis Shoe</I> (Severe) and <I>Hope</I> (V Diff).  At Gogarth, Doug and Stu climbed <I>Zeus</I> (E2, 5b) and a couple of "ex-preses" tottled up <I>Dream of White Horses</I> (HVS, 4c).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scotland and CUMC had a bit of a falling out this year.  Those lucky few who caught the cold snap at Christmas enjoyed <I>Green Gully</I> (Matt B. and Stu) and <I>Tower Ridge</I> (Dave, Lizzie and Paul) on the Ben, while Roz and party had a big adventure on <I>Curved Ridge</I> (Buchaille Etive Mor).  Club activity was otherwise rather muted but Scott and Dave caught <I>NE Buttress</I> in very mixed mood and several parties swam their way up <I>Tower Scoop, Gardyloo Gully</I> and <I>Central Gully (R-Hand)</I> on the Ben in a downpour!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mind you, epics were once again back in fashion with the Club.  You can read about Roz and party up on the Buchaille, but hot on their heels were Stu and Martin on <I>Slingsby's Chimney</I> (Ben Nevis), Pete and Helen on Cloggy's <I>Great Slab</I> and Amos and Dave (who got into a spot of bother with the authorities...)  One or two of the club also kept the "chopper-folk" happy this year when Tom P's bergschrund jump left his ankle rattling around inside his plastic boot followed by some Irish fool and Scott, who needed 'extraction' (by moon), from <I>The Moon</I> (Gogarth).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Elsewhere, the Alps, as always, proved popular.  No less than 15 members of the club climbed Mont Blanc including Tom B. and me via the <I>Central Pillar of Freney</I> and Martin, who achieved his Alpine Grande Course on <I>Route Major</I>.  Several "old-timers" avoided the queues for the Midi-pherique and went up the <I>Frendo Spur</I> while further afield, Amos and Tom P. climbed the <I>Matterhorn</I> and Leyla and Martin the <I>Dibona</I> (Ecrins).  Doug managed to have a peek at the <I>North Face of the Eiger</I> but decided it looked more friendly from the valley!  Stu continued to crank himself up 'hard things', most notably <I>Raindogs</I> Fr8a (Malham), <I>Deathwish</I> E7, 6b (Blue Scar) and <I>Deathwatch</I> E7, 6c (Ilkley) (sound very pleasant!) as well as storming the Sheffield bastion of the Foundry by winning the Universities Bouldering Competition.  Others sneaked off do the likes of  <I>Heart of the Sun</I> (E2, 5c) at Baggy (Leyla); <I>Cruel Sister</I> (E3, 5c) and <I>Eastern Hammer</I> (E3, 6a) in Langdale (Tom B. and Davc H.) and the <I>Inaccessible Pinnacle</I> on Skye (Dave, Lizzie and Toby).  I also amassed nearly 2 km of climbing on Fairhead - but still no-one seems to believe that Ireland is that good (or that dry!)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That said, the club moves enthusiastically into .html year, benefitting from some keen young blood and plenty of talent.  Most importantly, everyone continues to have a good laugh while the fine times and climbs seem set to go on.
