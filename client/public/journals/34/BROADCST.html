		<H1>The Big Broadcast </H1><HR>

	  <P>GOOD afternoon, 
		everybody. Well, here we are at Idwal our broadcast of an ascent of the 
		Holly Tree Wall. I have a few moments to describe the scene to you. There 
		are several hundred spectators � wouldn�t you say (<I>Oh, fully that, 
		I think</I>) � grouped on the easier slabs below the wall. A band of pilgrims 
		from the Tooth and Nail Club have just finished &quot;On Ilkley Moor Baht 
		�At.&quot; Ah, here come the protagonists - you can hear the applause 
		if I open the box, which has been suspended at considerable expense and 
		an angle of 45 degrees from a large piton, by a firm of rock engineers 
		from Munich. I�m told they brought up a pneumatic drill for the job. The 
		climb is in splendid condition, isn�t it? (<I>Oh, splendid.</I>) </P>
	  <P>Now the 
		climbers are roping up. I think Isaacs of the C.U.M.C. is leading, don�t 
		<I>you (Yes, I think it�s he</I>), and Plimsoll of the Tooth and Nail 
		is the other (<I>Yes, I think so</I>). Ah! now they�re off. No they�re 
		not � the rope is tangled. Now they�re freeing it � they�re getting it 
		free � it�s free � they're off. The leader is looking for a foothold for 
		his left foot (<I>Pitch one</I>). He has his right arm jammed in a convenient 
		crack � he�s lifting his knee up � up � I think he can just make that 
		Ieft hand-hold � will he? � he�s pushing hard now with that right hand 
		� Plimsoll is backing up magnificently � he's got it! Oh! lovely movement, 
		Sir! </P>
	  <P>Isaacs made 
		a great effort to pass that spot and now he�s going full speed for the 
		cave. He�s got there now � he�s reached the belay (<I>between pitches 
		one and two</I>). He doesn�t look too comfortable, but Number Two is getting 
		ready to start now. He's a good man too - do you remember that mantelshelf 
		on the last pitch of Green Ghyll last Easter<I>? (Yes, rather - good show 
		that was.</I>) Now he�s off. He � </P>
	  <P>Here, owing 
		to a technical hitch, the commentary broke off, to be resumed some ten 
		minutes later. </P>
	  <P>Isaacs is 
		now starting to climb the crack above the Holly Tree (<I>Pitch three</I>). 
		He has his right foot in � no, it�s out again. Never in that time. He�s 
		putting it in again � out it comes again. Climbers nowadays seem to find 
		great difficulty in getting their feet fairly into a crack, don�t they 
		<I>(Yes, I think so</I>). Ah! it�s in properly this time. There he goes, 
		slowly up, I�ll give you the time in a minute. Are you ready? (<I>Yes. 
		Left � right � left � right � left...</I>) � he�s doing 32 scrabbles to 
		the minute � he�s making ground steadily � Ohhhh! he slipped back and 
		lost all his ground, and took most of the Holly Tree with him. So that 
		concludes our broadcast of the first descent of the Holly Tree Wall. Good 
		afternoon, everybody. (<I>We are now going back to the studio for dance 
		music until 5.15 by Sammy Hall and his Rhythm Boys.</I>) </P>
