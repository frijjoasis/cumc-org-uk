	  <P>IAN and I crossed 
	  over the stream and undressed on the rocks on the other side. It is a comforting 
	  thing to stand up naked in the sunshine and know that except for a forester 
	  and a few woodmen down the valley there is no soul within many miles. For 
	  an hour we played to and fro, working slowly down stream; paddling in pools 
	  but not staying in them long because the water was very cold. It was April 
	  and the snows were melting. Although the sun was hot, the stream comes down 
	  nearly all the way deep among rocks and under trees and the sun gets very 
	  little chance to warm it. We built a few dams and broke them again, but 
	  did not do much of that either because the stream was too fast; a dam had 
	  to be made of big stones to stand against it and became a constructive work 
	  of engineering and not the dilettante artistry of lazy playing. A couple 
	  of hundred yards down stream we found a big boulder which we climbed by 
	  several routes up and down, balancing with a delicate and refined poise 
	  which would - have delighted the heart of Agag and clearly proved the futility 
	  of boots. <p>

	  <P>We came 
		back upstream again and lay down on a flat rock near to where we had undressed. 
		I began to draw Ian as he sat reading a book, but he had got into a very 
		unkind position with the sun slanting across his back so that every little 
		ripple of muscle threw a shadow. I soon found it too difficult and gave 
		it up. </P>
	  <P>At the top 
		of the valley the Pointa Gialba was standing up, a patchwork pyramid of 
		black and dazzling white in the sunshine, exactly framed between the tree-covered 
		slopes below. It stands on the main ridge which runs the whole length 
		of the island. Next day we were going to try La Mufrella, which lies away 
		to the south, and come back along the ridge. We were not likely to have 
		time to get up Gialba, but we might be able to. Probably the col to the 
		south of him would be as far as we should get before coming down. </P>
	  <P>A little 
		green lizard ran out on the rock to inspect such a large intruder. Twice 
		he ran past below me and then came cautiously nearer while I sat very 
		still. He came within an inch of my big toe but there were no flies on 
		me and he soon went away. </P>
	  <P>Then I began 
		going over in my mind the climb of the day before, We had tried to get 
		up a big aiguille on the North ridge of the Capo el Ceppo. He has never 
		been climbed yet and we failed to get anywhere near the top. It had been 
		a grand day, but I had been a little frightened two or three times. The 
		first, just after we roped, was a traverse across and up steep slabs. 
		The ledge was adequate but it was very exposed, and though we strung the 
		rope out to its fullest extent, just for a few feet we were all five moving 
		together. Then, higher up, we had gone up a very steep groove from which 
		the only chance of escape was by grasping round the waist a young and 
		active holly bush far away on the left. I was second and without shame 
		I steadied myself on the rope. In the end we had reached the crest of 
		the ridge, and it was no small feat of our leaders to have got us there. 
		We tried to get up the ridge towards the aiguille but we soon turned back 
		in a strong unpleasant wind. We were to see two days later that even above 
		that gendarme only a very patient centipede could have got along the ridge. 
		The mountain kept back its ace until the very last trick on the way down. 
		The whole hillside faded away to a little ledge on a great vertical wall, 
		and the only way off was by an inverted stomach traverse. I had moved 
		to last on the rope. It turned out to be reasonably easy, but Ian, who 
		was next to me, and I had the worst of it, waiting while the others disappeared 
		one by one round the corner, for we could not see what the pitch was like. 
		But I had the vast satisfaction of tying on to a rope, and kicking off 
		into space, a bundle of five sacks and five axes and watching them go 
		plunk against the rock. </P>
	  <P>We were 
		brought back to the present by the voice of our leader calling us in to 
		lunch, and we reluctantly put on an adequate number of clothes and shoes, 
		for the path to the cave where we were living passed beside a holly tree. 
		The cook tried condensed milk in the buttered eggs; an interesting experiment. 
		</P>
	  <P>As soon 
		as lunch was over we went back to the stream and undressed again. About 
		three oâ€™clock, after the prescribed time for digestion and a little more, 
		I felt moved to bathe. There was a deep, smooth pool just below and the 
		water was not as cold as it might have been. I really enjoyed it and I 
		do not often enjoy cold water on the body. With a splutter I climbed on 
		to a rock and danced a step-dance, my only quick movements the whole of 
		that day. Then I took a book and went a little way downstream to a sunny 
		rock under the bank, where my toes could trail in the water and the splash 
		from a little fall wetted me gently as high as the knees. </P>
	  <P>A car came 
		up from the town with our half-weekly relief of bread and butter and eggs, 
		turned with difficulty just below our camp where the track stopped, and 
		went away again. One of the party appeared with a bowl of potatoes and 
		a knife, and went away later commended by all with every one of them peeled. 
		And I went on reading and dreaming and reading a little more till the 
		sun was near to leaving the water and it was time to paddle upstream to 
		my clothes. </P>
