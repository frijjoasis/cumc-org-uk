	  <P>BY way of 
		a little preliminary training for more strenuous things to come, the season 
		opened for my wife and myself with a brief visit to the charming mountain-resort 
		of &Ouml;ie on Norangsfjord, on the west coast of Norway. This lies in 
		the Sunnm&ouml;re (erstwhile Sondm&ouml;re) Group on the extreme north-west 
		of the Jotunheim district, where the mountains are perhaps of rather more 
		Alpine aspect than in many parts of Norway, and good glacier-work, as 
		well as rock-climbing, can be obtained in great variety. Ascents were 
		made of Slogen (5,114ft.), Kjeipen, and Sm&ouml;rskredtind, the latter 
		by the Western Ar&ecirc;te (often incorrectly referred to as North-west 
		Ar&ecirc;te), with descent, mostly glissading, by the north-west face 
		to the new Patchell hut. One’s recollections of this delightful region 
		are intimately bound up with two somewhat distinct features: the hospitality 
		of Mr. C. W. Patchell, the presiding genius at &Ouml;ie for the last thirty-five 
		years, after whom the said hut is named; and also the wonderfully lengthy 
		glissades obtainable thus early in the season – about 2,000 ft. in the 
		case of Slogen! Such snow, however, must have speedily disappeared, for 
		it was a season of quite exceptional dryness and sunniness in this part 
		of Norway. </P>
	  <P>From &Ouml;ie 
		it was but a four-hours’ run up the fjord to the important port of Aalesund, 
		whence we eventually sailed for East Greenland on June 28th. Our expeditionary 
		ship, the <I>Veslekari</I>, was a sealing sloop of about 180 tons burden, 
		and for the purpose she had been fitted out in style and degree of comfort 
		quite unusual for the Arctic. We hugged the coast of Norway as far north 
		as the Lofoten Islands, and thence struck westward across the Greenland 
		Sea to Jan Mayen, that remote and remarkable island which lies some 350 
		miles north-east of Iceland. </P>
	  <P>Jan Mayen 
		was subject to volcanic activity probably within historic times, though 
		it has now reached what is called the "solfatara stage," and only jets 
		of hot air or gas in a few localities are in evidence. This remote island 
		of only 32 miles in length is dominated by the great dormant cone of Beerenberg, 
		rising to but a few short of 8,000 ft. directly from the sea. Its flanks, 
		once the channels of molten lava streams, are now the run-ways of great 
		glaciers; and no more remarkable sight of such a character, where glacier 
		competes with frozen lava over several thousand feet of descent, can be 
		seen than on the western side of this beautifully symmetrical mountain. 
		Mr. J. M. Wordie's Cambridge party of 1921 made the first ascent of this 
		unusual peak, and though hampered by mist at the summit, they reported 
		a thrilling impression formed by the scene from the crater rim, where 
		one looked into a glacier-filled bowl of vast proportions. Through a remarkable 
		breach in the northern rim pours the Weyprecht Glacier in a series of 
		wonderfull ice-falls to the sea some 7,500 ft. below. </P>
	  <P>At least 
		two of our party, with the mountain fever strong upon us after four days' 
		imprisonment in a rolling sloop, were anxious to view and photograph this 
		summit scene, as well as ascertain the actual size of the crater, and 
		the writer had designs on a collection of volcanic rocks to supplement 
		that made by Wordie from the upper parts of the mountain. Having camped 
		at about 2,600 ft. on the south-west slopes of the mountain, Walter A. 
		Wood (A.C.) and I made our way up vast n&eacute;v&eacute; slopes, in thick 
		mist, to an altitude of 5,300 ft. by aneroid. A circuitous route amongst 
		large crevasses followed, and at 6,000 ft. a sudden and short-lived clearing 
		of the atmosphere revealed an astonishing view of the glacier we had come 
		up, and the barren lava fields beyond to the ocean. Ahead of us lay a 
		wide snow couloir sweeping up to the ice-encrusted rim of the crater. 
		It was apparent that this was the route of Wordie's party, and wishing 
		to adopt his suggested alternative for the upper part, and in order to 
		examine some rock outcrops <I>en route</I>, we struck across the couloir 
		to its northern confining buttress, which gave a mostly steep ice-climb 
		to the top. We looked over the edge into a mist-filled abyss and longed 
		in vain for a glimpse of the ice-filled crater said to be half a mile 
		in diameter. We climbed along the crater rim in a northerly direction 
		over several ice-towers, and just as we were deciding to retreat, owing 
		to driving hail, a startlingly close lightning flash and simultaneous 
		peal of thunder drove us precipitately off the exposed summit. The ice 
		being in good condition we were able to make good use of our crampons 
		in a part run and glissade, by numerous short cuts, down to our camp, 
		which we reached in two hours from the summit, compared with seven hours 
		for the ascent. Following through to the coast, and making a brief visit 
		to the observation station of the Austrian Polar Year party, we were on 
		board the <I>Veslekari</I> by 11 p.m. Our last sight of Beerenberg next 
		day was one of this superb mountain clear from crater-rim to sea-girt 
		base, its glacier draperies dazzlingly reflecting the golden arctic sun. 
		</P>
	  <P>The East 
		Greenland pack-ice belt gave no trouble this year, and we reached the 
		historic headland, Hope-with-Hope (lat. 73°), by July 13th. But land-fast 
		ice hugged the entrance to Franz Josef Fjord, which was to be our route 
		to operations in the interior near its head. Meanwhile we busied ourselves 
		for 10 days in the coastal fringe of islands, and the lower hill and tundra 
		country around Mackenzie Bay, although by dint of a lengthy track I managed 
		to catch the Giesecke Mountains, and ascend a great flat-topped summit 
		called Breidhausen of not more than 3,000 ft. Herds of musk-oxen were 
		seen, and numerous arctic hares, but no hungry polar bears that might 
		have warranted the additional item of a gun amongst one's equipment, and 
		load of collected specimens, during a hard sixteen hours' trek: one soon 
		learnt to dispense with these modern weapons, and rely solely, in case 
		of eventualities, on one's trusty ice-axe or geological hammer! </P>
	  <P>By July 
		23rd the ice in Franz Josef Fjord had eased, and we commenced our voyage 
		up this great and spectacular water-way, which runs 100 miles inland to 
		glaciers descending directly from the ice-cap. After some geological work 
		on the western side of Ymer Island we crossed to Andr&eacute;e Land in 
		order to examine the neighbourhood of the remarkable mountain, named by 
		the Austro-German Expedition in 1870 &quot;Teufelsschloss&quot; (or &quot;Devil’s 
		Castle&quot;). This rises abruptly from the fjord to a height of about 
		4,300 ft., and its precipices arc of stratiform quartzites and shells 
		of most varied and intensest hues. The mountain must have been the subject 
		of admiration, and perchance of challenge, to everyone who has passed 
		by, and certainly not the least so to us. Its impregnable walls on all 
		sides seemed to offer little hope of an ascent except by the stiffest 
		of climbs. However, from an anchorage in a little bay on its north-western 
		side it could be seen that the upper crags threw down great slopes of 
		scree which would effectively reduce the length of severer ascent. </P>

	  <P>Wood and 
		I left the shore at the unusual hour, for such a task, of 4. p.m., Such, 
		however, are the advantages of these northern latitudes that one cannot 
		be benighted, and on many occasions summits were visited within the midnight 
		hours; 1,500 ft. of screes was surmounted in forty minutes, and .html 
		1,500 ft. of scrambling up rotten rock brought us to the foot of a vertical 
		wall of yellow quartzite. Cracks and chimneys were soon espied, and not 
		more than 400 ft. of excellent climbing gave out on the scree-covered 
		south-west shoulder of the mountain. There to our surprise, and almost 
		disgust, we saw that at this corner (S.S.W.) an ascent could be made by 
		easy steps and scree runs almost to the plateau-like summit. The highest 
		point on the south-east side of the latter was reached at 7.45, and finding 
		no signs of a previous ascent we duly recorded the occasion by a cairn, 
		and completed thc record by inserting a grape-juice bottle therein. A 
		more astounding view of vividly coloured peaks around, and of the deep 
		blue ice-flecked fjord far below, it would be hard to imagine, but as 

		on all these occasions the business of topographical and geological survey 
		in hand kept us more than occupied during the full hour spent on the summit. 
		By means of the easier slopes spotted on the ascent we made all speed 
		downward, and reached the shore within six hours of our departure therefrom. 
		The <I>Veslekari</I> was all excitement to be off in answer to a wireless 
		call for help from the Norwegian Government ship ashore in a fjord some 
		100 miles to the southward. All that night we proceeded at about 9 knots, 
		which was well in excess of our normal full speed, only to hear by morning 
		that the stranded vessel had meanwhile been refloated. </P>
	  <P>Our next 
		objective was Ice Fjord, whose narrow winding canon is notorious for its 
		icebergs. However, last summer was so favourable in this respect that 
		we had no difficulty in steaming to its head. Here one was pent in by 
		steep mountain walls and the great ice fronts of the J&auml;tte and De 
		Geer Glaciers, which descend from the Inland Ice. These are wont to &quot;calve&quot; 
		immense bergs from time to time, setting up veritable &quot;tidal&quot; 
		waves, and covering the fjord with ice-blocks of all sizes. No footing 
		on these dangerously active ice-fronts could be obtained, and our only 
		access into the mountains was by one steep valley whose glacier did not 
		reach the fjord. A geological reconnaissance was made into these previously 
		unexplored mountains, and from a camp at about 3,700 ft., in the course 
		of two hard days, a good many summits of between 7,000 and 8,000 ft. were 
		explored and roughly mapped. Looking southward from one of these we could 
		see Petermann Peak, the highest of the region (9,650 ft.), the first ascent 
		of which was made by Wordie’s Cambridge party in 1929. But what in this 
		view were of even greater interest were, apparently, Wordie’s &quot;Mystery 
		Lakes,&quot; lying in ice-free country between us and Petermann Peak, 
		and beyond a great bend of the J&auml;tte Glacier. </P>
	  <P>Our immediate 
		interest now lay in the unexplored country between Petermann Peak and 
		the J&auml;tte Glacier, a complicated tract of mountain-nunatakkr and 
		glaciers bordering the Inland Ice-cap. Access to this seemed more promising 
		from the head of the Franz Josef Fjord than Ice Fjord, and August 5th 
		saw us making our way up to the former, via what must be one of the most 
		impressively spectacular water-ways in the world. At one point the great 
		cliffs of Attestupan fall 5,900 ft. sheer into the water, and glaciers 
		plunge down to the water’s edge from similar elevations. Into the head 
		of the Franz Josef Fjord flows the great Nordenski&ouml;ld Glacier, which, 
		as is usual with these active arctic ice-streams, contributes its quota 
		of bergs and ice-debris to the waters of the fjord, and some seasons makes 
		it impossible to approach within 4 or 5 miles of the ice-front. In this 
		respect conditions were favourable last summer, for we were able to make 
		a landing on the north side of the fjord, at a point which often is quite 
		impossible of access. A not too promising opening in the abrupt mountain 
		barrier suggested a possible way in to the district of the &quot;Mystery 
		Lakes.&quot; An exciting preliminary reconnaissance showed that this was 
		the case, and during a long day’s trek from the fjord two of us reached 
		the snout of Wordie’s Gregory Glacier, from which we could view the &quot;Mystery 
		Lakes&quot; at close quarters. A chain of camps was established and a 
		survey of the district by photo-theodolite accomplished. The Lakes themselves, 
		if not mysterious, turned out to be of considerable interest. An upper 
		one of about ¾ mile in length drained into a lower one of larger size, 
		which was pent up by the great lateral wall of the J&auml;tte Glacier. 
		Scattered around the lake basin, but above the present surface of the 
		late, were huge blocks of ice, one of which was 50 ft. in height. Examination 
		showed that the lake was none other than a &quot;Marjelen See,&quot; which 
		periodically increased or diminished in volume according to the drainage 
		facilities in the retaining ice-dam of the moving J&auml;tte Glacier, 
		and that during a higher stand of the lake level bergs must have &quot;calved&quot; 
		from the ice-cliff, now towering some 500 ft. above the water, and floated 
		out to present anomalous positions. During a first exploration these lakes, 
		my wife and I also made our way some miles the great J&auml;tte Glacier 
		itself, in the direction of the Inland , but one’s movements on this gigantic 
		ice-stream were impeded by its pinnacled and crevassed surface. Important 
		geological evidence was, however, obtained from its moraines, as well 
		as from the great mountain faces of the Petermann Range cut by the glacier 
		and seen in section in its upper reaches. </P>

		Nordenski&ouml;ld Glacier and Nathorst Peak</DIV>
	  <P>Attention 
		was now paid to the latter range, extending north from Petermann Peak 
		itself, as well as to the mountains south of the Gregory Glacier. Several 
		fine summits were ascended either in company with my wife or with Walter 
		Wood. Of these the chief were a fine Rothorn-like peak of about 8,700 
		ft., rising some 10 miles to the north of Petermann Peak, and second or 
		third only to it in altitude in the immediate neighbourhood; and Nathorst 
		Peak (<I>ca</I>. 7,800 ft.), lying between the Gregory and Nordenski&ouml;ld 
		Glaciers. The former gave in its upper parts over 2,000 ft. of rockclimbing 
		and scrambling on excellently firm quartzite, all with perfect inward 
		dip, as well as a midnight view of unspeakably delicate tinting over Inland 
		Ice and mountain nunatak, from a remarkably sharp and isolated summit. 
		This point seems to be identifiable with Wordie’s Mount &quot;Gog&quot; 
		as seen from the Cambridge Peaks across the Nordenski&ouml;ld Glacier 
		(see <I>Geographical Journal</I>, Sept. 1927, opp. page 229). </P>
	  <P>Nathorst 
		Peak yielded, besides important topographical and geological data, an 
		expedition of great variety, and from our northern approach a successful 
		issue seemed at first by no means assured. The northern face drops in 
		great precipices to a very steep and broken glacier, and an extensive 
		flanking movement to the south-west was at once indicated. This led us 
		up the Gregory Glacier, almost to the foot of Petermann Peak, and thence 
		north-eastward over a glacier pass and a number of subsidiary summits 
		to a lofty saddle perched at 7,000 ft. between a remarkable yellowish 
		granite feature, dubbed by us &quot;Orange Crest,&quot; and Nathorst Peak 
		itself. The final 600 to 700 ft. gave a climb that under worse snow conditions 
		might have proved really hard, and from the summit it appeared that the 
		eastern ar&ecirc;te should probably make the easier final approach. But 
		from whatever side the peak is attacked it will always be a worthy expedition. 
		An hour of observations on the narrow crest with a chilly wind and temperature 
		of 23°F., drove us precipitately down to the saddle, and wishing to avoid 
		the long detour to the south-west, we decided on a direct descent of the 
		steep northern face. Donning crampons, we embarked on a hard ice couloir 
		at a measured inclination of 40-45°, which led us in one fell swoop of 
		1,000 ft. to a steep cascading glacier, and thence through well-sealed 
		crevasses to the main &quot;Nathorst Glacier,&quot; whose junction with 
		the Gregory Glacier, some 1,200 ft. above us, we had crossed earlier in 
		the day. This precipitate descent, totalling 3,100 ft. in fifty minutes, 
		cut off without doubt many miles of detour, but the long return to our 
		nearest camp in the Gregory Valley, heavily loaded as we were with rock 
		specimens and instruments, seemed to eke out a sufficiently lengthy expedition 
		of nineteen hours. </P>
	  <P>An interesting 
		geographical discovery hereabouts was the fact that the Gregory Glacier 
		is in two parts, the upper portion, which swings past the foot of Petermann 
		Peak, taking an abrupt turn to the south-east out of its natural valley 
		and flowing into the Nordenski&ouml;ld Glacier on the north side of Nathorst 
		Peak. The apparent lower continuation of the Gregory Glacier, towards 
		the &quot;Mystery Lakes,&quot; as seen by Wordie’s party from the top 
		of Petermann Peak, is in actuality .html glacier whose head snows lie 
		in a cirque some 5 or 6 miles north of that peak. Other expeditions in 
		the neighbourhood, some of which had to be accomplished solo, and which 
		if particularly strenuous and lengthy on account of concurrent topographical 
		and geological work, yet afforded some of the most delightful days that 
		it has yet been my lot to spend in the mountains, whether of higher or 
		lower latitudes. </P>
