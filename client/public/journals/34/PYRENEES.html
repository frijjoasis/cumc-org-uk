		<H1>Ten days in the Pyrenees</H1><HR>
		<H2>H.J.H. Drummond</H2>
		<H3>Christ's</H3>
	  
	  <P>THE Pyrenees 
		are a range comparatively unknown to British climbers, which to those 
		who know these mountains must surely seem a fate they little deserve. 
		It is true that the expert mountaineer, whose only wish is for entirely 
		new or difficult ascents, will have little use for them, but to the climber 
		of more modest ambitions they are a true paradise. </P>
	  <P>Rock climbs 
		are numerous, and for the most part the rock is easy, though in places 
		somewhat rotten, but on several peaks, notably the Vignemale, Balaitous, 
		the Pic du Midi d’Ossau, and the mountains of the Maladetta group, there 
		are, for those who want them, routes as difficult as many of the first-class 
		Alpine climbs. As none of the Pyrenean peaks rise to a height of much 
		over 11,000 ft., and as in summer the snow-line averages about 10,000, 
		there are few pure snow-climbs to be found, though the vast majority of 
		the ascents combine rock with a certain amount of snow, and sometimes 
		with ice-work as well, though glaciers are far from numerous. </P>
	  <P>Pyrenean 
		scenery is very beautiful; to some it is even finer than that of the Alps. 
		This is partly because it is more varied, and has several distinctive 
		features. Chief among these are the canon-like valleys of the Spanish 
		Pyrenees and the &quot;cirques.&quot; This is the name given to the vast, 
		natural amphitheatres, often two or three miles across, formed at the 
		heads of certain valleys by the mountains rising in precipices several 
		thousands of feet in height. Another probable reason for the beauty of 
		Pyrenean scenery is the vast number of separate peaks, of which, in any 
		given area, there must be far more in the Pyrenees than in the Alps. The 
		lakes, too, though very much smaller, are more numerous and provide great 
		variety of colouring. </P>
	  <P>The charm 
		of these mountains lies partly in their comparative freedom from the inroads 
		of trippers and sightseers. Apart from one or two important centres like 
		Gavarnie or Luchon, there are no resorts with palatial hotels, caf&eacute;s, 
		bandstands, and so on, such as exist everywhere in the Alps. Villages, 
		especially on the Spanish side, are few and far between, but in the majority 
		of them cheap and comfortable inns are to be found. In recent years the 
		French Alpine Club and the Catalan Touring Club have erected many very 
		convenient huts for the use of climbers. Two or three of them are very 
		comfortable, providing beds and excellent food, but in most the climber 
		has to cook for himself and sleep on a bed of straw. </P>
	  <P>Anyone whose 
		climbing ambitions do not aim too high, and who does not mind roughing 
		it to a greater extent than is necessary in the more civilized Alps, could 
		not do better than spend a holiday on foot in the Pyrenees. </P>
	  <P>On August 
		8, 1932, I set out from Eaux-Bonnes with a cousin and a friend for a short 
		tour of the Pyrenees. We drove up the Sallent road as far as the Pont 
		de Soques, some two or three miles below the frontier pass, the Col de 
		Portalet. </P>
	  <P>Leaving 
		Soques at 9 a.m. in glorious weather, we mounted east up the Val d’Arrius, 
		following a path along the bank of . the torrent. An hour later we struck 
		off to our right, and climbing first over grass, then up a long slope 
		of scree and 6nally up a long gully, we reached the summit of the Pic 
		de Sobe, 8,530 ft., shortly before 1 o’clock. There we sat and ate our 
		lunch and gazed on the wonderful scene that was unfolded before us on 
		all sides. </P>
	  <DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="PICSOBE.jpg" WIDTH="347" HEIGHT="265" ALT="View from Pic de Sobe" BORDER="1"><BR>
		View from Pic de Sobe</DIV>
	  <P>To the west, 
		the Pic du Midi d’Ossau towered, Cervin-like, high above a wilderness 
		of lower peaks and ridges; to the south the Spanish mountains, with their 
		great variety of colouring – grey, black, and red – and their curious 
		formations, unlike anything that is to be found in the Alps, stretched 
		mile after mile, till the farthest ridges seemed to blend with the distant 
		horizon itself. To the east lay the valley of Piedrafita with its lakes, 
		whose waters were a brilliant blue. Beyond, a veritable sea of mountains 
		extended as far as the eye could see, while to the north we caught glimpses 
		of the plain of France. </P>
	  <P>After an 
		hour’s rest we started to descend to the east, first over grass, then 
		down a chimney, and finally over long slopes of scree into a little basin 
		of snow, from which, after a short ascent, we reached the Col de Sobe, 
		lying between the Pic de Sobe and the Pic d’Arriel. There we rested for 
		a while, but as the weather was now beginning to look threatening, we 
		soon set off for our objective, the Refuge d’Arr&eacute;moulit, a hut 
		erected on the shores of the lake of the same name by the French Alpine 
		Club. Descending to the north, we then turned east and reached a point 
		above the Col d’Arrius, where we struck a short-cut leading direct to 
		the Refuge and obviating the necessity of a descent into the valley. This 
		path, made by the French Alpine Club, has been cut out of the mountain-side 
		above a precipice. As we made our way along it, we caught glimpses through 
		the drifting mist of the Lac d’Artouste hundreds of feet below us. Presently 
		we came upon an open plateau, a wilderness of rocks and boulders, sloping 
		gradually down to the Lac d’Arr&eacute;moulit, where we reached the Refuge 
		shortly before 7 p.m. </P>
	  <P>As this 
		hut is typical of the majority of the unguarded Pyrenean climbing huts, 
		a brief description of it may be of interest. Built substantially of stone, 
		it measures roughly 15 ft. by 10 ft. Half the floor space is taken up 
		with the sleeping-quarters, a low platform covered with straw, above which 
		there is a kind of loft at the height of about 6 ft. from the floor. The 
		only articles of furniture are a stone table, two stone benches, a couple 
		of shelves, and a few hooks. </P>
	  <P>Though mist 
		was swirling about us on all sides, it was a warm evening, and we sat 
		on the bench outside the but to eat our supper. Just before sunset the 
		mist cleared, and a wonderful sight lay before us. At our feet was the 
		lake, its waters black and forbidding, all around it lay a wild and barren 
		wilderness of chaotic rocks and boulders – a typical feature of Pyrenean 
		scenery – then a n&eacute;v&eacute;, above which towered the steep rocks 
		of Arriel and Pallas, dark and menacing, their tops alone tinged with 
		red in the glow of sunset. </P>
	  <P>With the 
		fall of night the air grew cold, and we were glad to seek the comparative 
		warmth of the hut, where we settled down to a card-game. We were soon 
		disturbed, however, by the sound of footsteps outside the hut, and we 
		wondered who this belated traveller could be. It was a young Frenchman 
		from Toulouse, and he told us with evident satisfaction that, with two 
		companions, who were following some way behind him, he had that day made 
		the first descent of the north-west ar&ecirc;te of the Balaitous (the 
		Matterhorn of the Pyrenees). By the time his friends had arrived, he had 
		cooked some supper for them: we left them to it and, climbing up into 
		the loft, lay down and were soon asleep. </P>
	  <P>Next morning 
		we were astir soon after g o’clock: a needlessly early hour in the circumstances, 
		for as my cousin, who had only arrived from home two days before, wanted 
		to rest, he and I had decided to spend the day in the neighbourhood of 
		the hut. It was a beautiful day and we passed the time very successfully 
		doing nothing. </P>
	  <P>The following 
		morning we set out shortly before 6 a.m. and half an hour later were on 
		the Col d’Arr&eacute;moulit, 500 ft. above the Refuge at a height of 8,000 
		ft. There we had an admirable view of our objective – Frondella, a 10,000 
		ft. peak to the south of Balaitous – and for a few minutes we studied 
		our proposed line of ascent. After descending a few hundred feet, we traversed 
		the head of a valley; when we had reached the other side, we started to 
		mount by the side of a torrent up steep slopes of scree. Passing a small 
		lake we turned to our right and crossed the torrent just below the main 
		Frondella glacier. We then rounded a spur, and came into a vast basin 
		of rock and glacier, with the rocky west and central peaks of Frondella 
		rising above it on the far side. Here we saw at least thirty chamois, 
		of which several passed within a few yards of us. Mounting steadily up 
		the glacier we presently came to the bergschrund, which we had little 
		difficulty in crossing, and after half an hour’s scramble up easy rocks, 
		or rather over a chaotic mass of boulders, we traversed the central peak 
		and reached the highest point of Frondella, the eastern peak, at 10.30. 
		</P>
	  <P>The view 
		from the top was glorious, and we spent quite half an hour gazing at the 
		sea of mountains that stretched around us on all sides as far as the eye 
		could see. At our feet lay the beautiful valley of Piedrafita, and beside 
		one of its many lakes we could discern the white roof of the hut at which 
		we hoped to spend the night. By the time we had had some lunch and were 
		ready to start down, it was dose on mid-day. Returning to the central 
		peak, we descended direct to the south, in the opposite direction to that 
		in which we had come up; our route lay down a gully, which opened out 
		into a long and steep snow couloir, down which we had to Hck steps. When 
		we had reached the foot of the couloir, we continued the descent first 
		over long slopes of scree and then down alternate stretches of grass and 
		rock into the valley, arriving at the hut at 3.30. The day had been very 
		warm and a delightfully cool bathe in one of the many lakes of the neighbourhood 
		was both welcome and refreshing. </P>
	  <P>The following 
		morning we left the hut at 7.30 in glorious weather, and proceeding due 
		east up the valley of Piedrafita we reached the Col de la Fache, 8,983 
		ft., at 9.30. There we turned south and climbed the northern ar&ecirc;te 
		of the Grande Fache, mounting steadily up easy if somewhat rotten rock 
		to reach the summit, 9,863 ft., an hour later. We were again rewarded 
		by a superb view, which there was not a cloud in the sky to obscure. Close 
		at hand, to the south-west, lay the black crest of the Pic d’Enfer, to 
		the north-west rose Frondella and Balaitous, while to the south-east towered 
		the great mass of the Vignemale. Due east, in the far distance, we could 
		distinguish Pic N&eacute;thou, the highest point in the Pyrenees, 11,160 
		ft. We ate our lunch and were ready to start down by mid-day We descended 
		due west down the face, where the rock was easy, though steep and rather 
		rotten. Having descended a thousand feet, we turned south and then, crossing 
		a col, bore to the south-east down a low but precipitous wall of rock 
		into a couloir of snow and scree. Passing under the rocky cr&ecirc;te 
		of the Pic Falisse, we came to the Port de Marcadeau, 8,420 ft., one of 
		the principal passes between France and Spain, and much used in former 
		times by smugglers. Passing over the Port, we crossed again into France, 
		and descended the valley of Marcadeau by the mule-path, arriving at 4.30 
		at the Refuge Wallon, a primitive but comfortable inn, constructed at 
		a height of a little over 6,000 ft. in an ideal spot, some 8 or 10 miles 
		above the village of Cauterets. </P>
	  <P>Our objective 
		for the following day was the hamlet of Ordesa, in the valley of Arazas, 
		the Spanish National Park. The barometer fell during the night, and when 
		we started off punctually at 6 a.m. the sky was overcast. It grew blacker 
		and blacker away to the west, as we mounted due south up a desolate and 
		rock-strewn valley towards the frontier. As we passed over the Col d’Aratille 
		(8,000 ft.) into Spain, the weather improved, and though it threatened 
		again from time to time, the rain held off all day. We descended into 
		the valley of the Rio Ara, which here, at its upper end, is singularly 
		uninteresting – a mere barren desert, without the desolate grandeur, which 
		no words can describe, of many of the great chaotic, boulder- strewn Pyrenean 
		wastes. After several miles the floor of the valley narrows, and the path 
		winds along the top of a gorge while the mountains rise up steeply on 
		either side. Presently, near the village of Bucharo, it widens again considerably; 
		here the mountain-sides are covered with pine forests, above which rocky 
		precipices tower into the sky. A few miles below Bucharo we turned east 
		into the lateral valley of Arazas, and an hour later, soon after 5 p.m., 
		we reached the hamlet and inn of Ordesa. </P>
	  <P>No tour 
		of the Pyrenees would be complete without a visit to this valley, one 
		of the most beautiful of the range. In Europe it is unique of its kind, 
		and it can only be compared to the Grand Canon of Colorado. Above the 
		floor of the valley, which in many places forms a narrow gorge with numerous 
		waterfalls, the mountain-sides are covered first with an under- growth 
		of box, then with beech-trees, and higher up still with magnificent pine 
		forests. Above these, rocks, of many colours, ranging between grey and 
		red, rise sheer into the air, forming a series of precipitous and quite 
		unscalable cliffs, each separated by grass terraces of a brilliant green. 
		The formation of the tops of these cliffs is most striking, and often 
		resembles the crenelated battlements of an ancient mountain stronghold. 
		</P>
	  <P>We were 
		loth to leave such a beautiful spot, so it did not take us long to decide 
		that we would rest upon the following day. The inn was very primitive, 
		but the food was excellent and the beds comfortable. Accordingly we all 
		slept late, and spent a very lazy morning. In the afternoon my cousin 
		and I walked down to Torla, the nearest village of any size, about 6 miles 
		away. It is a very old town, clustering round an ancient church and a 
		still older fortress. The cobbled streets are very narrow, and at the 
		time of our visit were exceedingly dirty; in fact the whole place reeked 
		of poverty and squalor. </P>
	  <P>From Ordesa 
		it was our intention to make our way over into France again, climbing 
		Mont Perdu en route, but on the first day only to go as far as the Refuge 
		de Gaulis, on the near side of Mont Perdu, and about four hours’ walk 
		from Ordesa. Accordingly, we did not set out the following day till nearly 
		3 p.m. A thunderstorm had been threatening all day; rain came on soon 
		after we left, and before we had got much more than half-way to the hut, 
		the storm broke in real earnest. Our route lay due east up the valley 
		of Arazas; at the head of the valley the rocks rise precipitously, but 
		in one place, where the holds are firm and plentiful, they are easy enough 
		to scale. Above this a vast and desolate wilderness of rock-strewn grassland 
		rises in numerous terraces to the foot of the great limestone ridge known 
		as the &quot;massif calcaire,&quot; of which Mont Perdu is the highest 
		point. When we reached the top of the rocks we could see the Refuge de 
		Gaulis, a small hut built upon one of these terraces. As we mounted towards 
		it the storm increased every minute in intensity, the rain grew heavier 
		and heavier and we were soaked to the skin by the time we reached the 
		hut at exactly 7 p.m. Inside we found three Germans, who were spending 
		the night there on their way down to civilization, after an unsuccessful 
		attempt to climb Mont Perdu – they had been unable to find the way in 
		the mist and clouds that had lain thick upon the mountains all that day. 
		A change of shirt relieved the clamminess of our wet clothes to a certain 
		degree, and then a hearty supper was all that was necessary to make our 
		somewhat dampened spirits rise once more. </P>
	  <P>Meanwhile 
		the storm had passed over; but by the time we turned in, rain had come 
		on again, and we soon woke up to find it pouring in through the roof on 
		that side of the hut where all our belongings were stored, and before 
		we could rescue them, they were soaked through – clothes, food, ruck-sacks 
		– everything. Fortunately, apart from letting in a few drops, the roof 
		did not leak over the low straw-covered plat- form which served as our 
		bed, and when we had removed all our belongings to a dry corner, we were 
		soon being lulled to sleep again by the loud pattering of a few persistent 
		raindrops falling on the stone floor of the hut. </P>
	  <P>We looked 
		outside hopefully at intervals of an hour from 4 a.m. onwards, but each 
		time came the report that the rain, though alight, was falling steadily, 
		and that the clouds were very low down. By 8 o’clock we had decided that 
		it would be useless to attempt the ascent of Mont Perdu that day. There 
		was nothing for it but to spend the day in the hut, or else to return 
		to our inn at Ordesa. We fixed at once upon the former alternative, for 
		our time was limited, and we did not wish to waste a day by returning 
		to a place where we had already been. The following day, however, we would 
		have to make a move, whatever the weather, as our provisions would be 
		running short; as it was we had to make two days’ provisions last for 
		three. </P>
	  <P>Our friends 
		the Germans set out at about 8 o’clock to return to Ordesa; soon afterwards 
		the rain stopped, but the weather still looked so threatening that we 
		did not alter our decision not to climb Mont Perdu that day. However, 
		at 9.30, as the rain still held off, and as we were all thoroughly cold 
		and wet, we decided to do a short and easy climb near the hut. We soon 
		got warm and, thanks to a strong wind, dry as well; and in better spirits 
		we returned to the hut about mid-day to find three young Spaniards, just 
		arrived from Ordesa, with the intention of spending the night there preparatory 
		to climbing Mont Perdu the following day. As we had to economize in food, 
		our lunch was somewhat meagre, and tea was a luxury in which we did not 
		indulge. We passed the afternoon talking, playing various card-games, 
		and listening to the storm raging once again outside. After an early supper 
		we turned in full of hope for the morrow. </P>
	  <P>Looking 
		out at 4 a.m. we found the rain had ceased, and though the sky was still 
		overcast, the douds were much higher, and altogether the weather looked 
		more promising. So at 5.30 we set out, accompanied by the three Spaniards. 
		Mounting steadily up numerous terraces of grass and rock, we then passed 
		through a large basin of snow, and reached, about 7.30, a small late entirely 
		frozen over, called the &quot;&Eacute;tang Glac&eacute;,&quot; situated 
		immediately below the Col du Cylindre, which separates the peak of that 
		name from Mont Perdu. From the lake we mounted south-east up a long and 
		wide snow couloir, which is very steep towards the top. It was full of 
		fresh snow, and as on one side it slopes away at the bottom over a precipice, 
		great care was necessary – incidentally, we were never roped. An hour 
		later we were on the top of Mont Perdu, 11,000 ft. in height, the third 
		highest mountain in the Pyrenees. Though the sky was still overcast, the 
		view was extensive and very fine; no words can describe the singular grandeur 
		of the mountains of the Mont Perdu &quot;massif.&quot; But thc wind was 
		too bitterly cold to allow us to remain long on the summit, and by 9.30 
		we were back at the &Eacute;tang Glac&eacute;, from where, after partaking 
		of a small second breakfast, we climbed a chimney to the Col du Cylindre. 
		Thence, after descending the upper glacier of Mont Perdu in a north-easterly 
		direction, we made our way down a rocky wall of some three or four hundred 
		feet in height, by a series of chimneys on to the lower glacier of Mont 
		Perdu. Traversing this, we reached the Lac Glac6, a lake about a kilometre 
		in length and more than half frozen over. Rounding the lake, we mounted 
		a steep couloir to the Br&egrave;che de Tuquerouye, a narrow <I>br&egrave;che</I> 
		in the rocky ridge which forms the back of the Cirque d’Estaub&eacute;: 
		a cold, exposed, and very draughty spot, one would imagine, yet here the 
		French Alpine Club have constructed a hut. It is, certainly, a good starting-point 
		for certain ascents, and the view, too, more than makes up for the disadvantages 
		of the situation. At one’s feet lies Lac Glac&eacute;, with its miniature 
		icebergs and above it towers the superb but desolate &quot;massif&quot; 
		of Mont Perdu, with its snowy crest, its glacier – the most deeply crevassed 
		if not quite the largest in the Pyrenees – and its steep and forbidding 
		rocks. </P>
	  <DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="ESTAUBE.jpg" WIDTH="346" HEIGHT="255" ALT="Cirque D'Estaube" BORDER="1"><BR>
		Cirque D'Estaube</DIV>
	  <P>We had stopped 
		to eat our lunch on the shores of Lac Glac&eacute; and by the time we 
		reached the hut it was nearly a p.m., and as the weather was threatening 
		once again, we decided to spend the night there. It was bitterly cold 
		during the night, and the wind swept howling through the br&egrave;che. 
		The dawn, however, broke brilliantly fine, and at about 7 a.m. we set 
		out on our last day’s walk, our objective being G&egrave;dre, a village 
		a few miles below Gavarnie. Making our way down a snow couloir on the 
		side of the <I>br&egrave;che</I> opposite to that by which we had come 
		up the previous day, we descended into the Cirque d’Estaub&eacute;. Then 
		came a long and somewhat dreary valley walk, through scenery for which, 
		though it was fine enough in its way, we had been rather spoiled by all 
		that we had seen during the last few days. Eventually we reached G&egrave;dre 
		at about 2.30, and an hour later caught the post-’bus down to Argel&egrave;s, 
		and so brought to an end a short but most enjoyable and successful tour.
