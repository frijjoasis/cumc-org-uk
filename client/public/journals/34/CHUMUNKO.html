      <H1>Chumunko, an episode of the 1933 Mount Everest expedition </h1><h>

		the quarter-inch Indian survey map of Sikkim, the name Chumunko is given 
		to a mountain a little north of the Natu La on the frontier between Sikkim 
		and the Chumbi Valley of Tibet; .html name, Simugupchurhi, is put down 
		near by. Several of our porters had often passed through this district, 
		but even when prompted they did not know either name. The form lines of 
		the map and the streams are only indicated diagrammatically, and the main 
		reason why we gave the name Chumunko to our mountain was, I think, because 
		it could more easily be pronounced. To us the significance of the climb 
		was in its relation to the Mount Everest Expedition as a whole, and not 
		that it was an ascent of a particular and hitherto unclimbed peak. Nevertheless, 
		as this account may be the only record, a photograph is reproduced here, 
		as it is probably the best way of defining the mountain which we climbed. 
		</P>
	  <P>The advance 
		party of the Mount Everest Expedition, on March 9th, reached a dak bungalow 
		at a height of 12,000 ft., attractively situated on the edge of a mountain 
		tarn called Tsomgo. The district had formerly been heavily glaciated, 
		and at this time of year when there was still a good deal of snow about 
		we were reminded of Scotland at Easter. It was an ideal place to spend 
		five or six days acclimatizing, and that we – actually needed acclimatization 
		was proved by the headaches and a disinclination to eat which we experienced 
		during a short scramble from the bungalow to 14,500 ft. </P>
	  <P>During this 
		short excursion we saw a shapely peak to the north, which looked both 
		near and accessible, and after a careful reconnaissance with field-glasses 
		we decided that the southern face of the mountain might perhaps be climbed. 
		The next day, Longland, Shipton, Wyn-Harris, and I set off for the mountain 
		with six Sherpa and Tibetan porters, who carried sleeping bags, two small 
		tents of Marco Pallis’s design, and food for three days. </P>
	  <P>Chumunko, 
		which was only 5 miles north of the dak bungalow according to the map, 
		was, however, not so accessible as we had thought, because on the north 
		facing slopes of the three valleys which we had to cross there was a thick 
		rhododendron scrub with snow below. The rhododendron only occurred on 
		north-facing slopes, the southern slopes being for some reason quite free, 
		and as we were travelling north we had to struggle with the scrub only 
		on the descents: but this was difficult enough, and we hoped to find an 
		alternative route on the way back. As none of us knew this type of country, 
		there was the constant problem of how much to contour, how much to attempt 
		to follow ridges, and how much to make a direct route down the rhododendron-covered 
		slopes and across the valleys. In the main we followed the shortest route, 
		but at the end of a hard day camp was pitched at the upper limit of trees 
		at a height of 11,500 ft. and 2,000 ft. or more below where we had hoped. 
		A great compensation was, however, a large fire of pine and rhododendron, 
		in the pleasant warmth of which we decided to rise next day at 5 a.m., 
		leave camp at 6, and go very slowly for our objective, willingly abandoning 
		it if it proved a strain due to our unfitness, or lack of acclimatization. 
		</P>
	  <P>The following 
		morning Wyn-Harris led off at exactly the right pace – I believe that 
		any of the other three of us would have been unable to have kept the pace 
		down – and as a result, after two and a half hours, we arrived as fresh 
		as if we had only just left our tents at a point about 3,000 ft. above 
		our camp. We felt, therefore, that we had lost little by being compelled 
		the day before to pitch camp so low. The south face of our mountain showed 
		a snowy triangular area of rocks, which led up to the lowest point of 
		the summit ridge, and we judged that this would be less steep than the 
		other parts of the face or the east and west ridges. The best line of 
		approach to this part seemed to be up a buttress below and to the left 
		of the less steep ground. </P>
	  <P>Wyn-Harris 
		and I, who were ahead, started up the buttress, but were soon slowed up 
		in a difficult chimney. Shipton, at Longland’s instigation, tried an alternative 
		route, but it was not for those who had long been away from the practice 
		grounds of the British Isles. I remember being mighty glad that it wouldn’t 
		go. At this stage, coming up second with the feeling that one must hurry 
		was exhausting in our unacclimatized condition, and not till I was ahead 
		later in the day did I shake off the conviction that I had forgotten how 
		to move rhythmically and comfortably over rocks of moderate difficulty 
		such as we were on. The climbing was, I believe, interesting, but I have 
		no clear recollections until the other party went ahead and forced a way 
		to the top of an iced chimney. This led to the top of the buttress and 
		to the bottom of the triangle of easier ground. Here we halted for five 
		minutes, and compelled ourselves to eat a biscuit; it seemed that we should 
		get up if time and the gathering clouds allowed us. </P>
	  <P>Delightful 
		slabs, then a traverse along snowy ledges, and finally a snow couloir 
		led to the lowest part of the summit ridge. From here the southern peak 
		was a scramble over easy rocks, and we reached the summit just before 
		noon. I suppose that our height was between 16,500 and 17,000 ft., and 
		we all felt a little headachy. Away to the north across a snow col was 
		a dull-looking peak, definitely a little higher than the one on which 
		we stood, and there was some discussion whether to go on or turn. I remember 
		expressing my opinion that we had got all the real satisfaction out of 
		the climb, and that to cross over the col and up the other peak, which 
		was hardly what we had set out to do, would perhaps make too long a day 
		and interfere with the mysterious processes of acclimatization. But I 
		was alone in this view, and on we went. I confess that I was personally 
		glad that we did, but I got a malicious satisfaction later that day to 
		find that height was apparently affecting me less than either Wyn-Harris 
		or Longland. </P>
	  <P>We reached 
		the second summit at five minutes past one, and we had previously decided 
		that there was no need to turn till f p.m. There was by now a good deal 
		of drifting cloud, and we saw only glimpses of the Scottish Highland country 
		to the south, and only one glimpse of Chomalhari in Tibet, rising to 23,000 
		ft.; the Kanchenjunga group remained in cloud. Soon after turning round 
		we were continuously enveloped in cloud and some hail fell. We had again 
		to climb the southern summit as traversing seemed impracticable, and as 
		we were descending from here to the lowest point of the summit ridge a 
		cold wind developed, blowing the rope out horizontally in handsome curves 
		in a way which I can never see without being pleasantly reminded of Mr. 
		Willink’s drawing in the Badminton book. On the face, Shipton and Longland 
		got ahead, and Wyn-Harris and I were further slowed up by the fear of 
		sending stones down on their heads. From the top of the buttress they 
		shouted through the cloud, telling us of their whereabouts, and suggested 
		that they should go on. We asked that the candle-lantern might be Ieft 
		there for us. I believe we thought ourselves the more exhausted party, 
		but when we got back we found that the others had thought the same about 
		themselves. The hail which had threatened to be serious had only put a 
		thin sprinkling on the rocks, and the descent was enjoyable despite our 
		headaches. Wyn-Harris and I led through each other as seemed appropriate 
		and talked of mountaineering etiquette, the good training we had received 
		as members of the Cambridge Mountaineering Club, and we reminisced about 
		Sunday mornings in Van Noorden’s rooms in Clare. The usual topic of food 
		did not particularly appeal to us. We reached camp half an hour after 
		the others, just as it got quite dark. </P>
	  <P>The following 
		morning at sunrise there were 2 in. of snow over everything, including 
		the porters who were sleeping huddled together in the open round a dead 
		fire. We Ieft early because we feared difficulties on the rhododendron-covered 
		slopes, but the journey was easier than we had anticipated; already we 
		had learnt something of how to deal with this particular difficulty and, 
		moreover, as our objective was definite we could rely more on the judgment 
		of our porters. </P>
	  <P>Chumunko 
		to all of us was a satisfying and nearly perfect episode. I do not wish 
		this to become an attempt to justify the excursion. It has been criticised 
		on the grounds that we overstepped our acclimatization. One of the party 
		had an abnormal form of Cheyne-Stokes breathing which lasted for two days, 
		which perhaps was caused by the climb. I emulated the pioneers of high 
		climbing by bleeding at the nose. On the other hand, afterwards it was 
		practicable to curb our desire for the many handsome peaks which are passed 
		on the way to Mount Everest, and undoubtedly Wyn-Harris and I, who for 
		several years had been unable to visit the Alps, profited by having our 
		confidence restored and our standards righted by climbing again with other 
		mountaineers on a peak of general Alpine character. </P>
