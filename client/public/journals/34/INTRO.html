		<H1>Cambridge Mountaineering </H1><HR>

	  
	  <P>WHEN, at 
		the beginning of the Michaelmas Term 1931, it was decided to produce .html 
		journal, the appointed editor was faced with the thankless task of collecting 
		material. Various members of the dub were prevailed upon to write articles 
		and notes, and application was made to former presidents for accounts 
		of almost forgotten meets. With a view to avoiding all this trouble in 
		the future it was decided that each president, during his stay in office, 
		should write up accounts of meets as soon as possible after their occurrence, 
		and further should endeavour to collect articles, notes, and photographs 
		from such members as appeared to be in a position to supply them. This 
		was an excellent idea, and so did it flourish under the care of energetic 
		presidents, that, far from having to collect material, the present editor 
		has come into a rich and blessed heritage. </P>
	  <P>In this 
		number, as compared with its predecessor, much more space is devoted to 
		accounts of meets and to notes. This is partly a result of the new system, 
		and partly because one of the chief objects of the journal is to keep 
		a record of new and interesting climbs done by members of the club: partly, 
		too, because it was felt that a diverse collection of essays was not an 
		adequate expression of the activities of the club as such. So if this 
		number loses in interest to others, we hope it will not lose in interest 
		to ourselves. </P>
	  <P>Turning 
		over past numbers of Cambridge Mountaineering one comes across short notes 
		on the progress and history of the C.U.M.C., but at the best they are 
		scanty and statistical, and perhaps it would not be out of place to elaborate 
		on the theme in this journal. </P>
	  <P>The origins 
		of the C.U.M.C. are to be found in a club which was founded in 1883 by 
		members of Trinity College to enable those interested in climbing in the 
		Alps to get together. Its formation was very largely due to the Rev. A. 
		V. Valentine-Richards, who, incidentally, had promised to write a history 
		of the dub for this journal, and would have done so but for his untimely 
		death. </P>
	  <P>Thus the 
		C.U.M.C. can claim to date back half a century, although for several years 
		the club was not open to the whole University. From the very start it 
		was an undergraduate club, but it has always had the strong and practical 
		support of all the climbing dons. Of its history up to 1914 little can 
		be unearthed. Mr. Valentine-Richards mentioned that it ceased to be for 
		a few years at one time and that its communal activities were limited 
		to talking and hearing other people talk. Complete minutes existed up 
		to 1914, but during the years of the War they went astray. </P>
	  <P>Like everything 
		else the C.U.M.C. was hard hit by the War and ceased to hold meetings, 
		but when things had got back to normal Mr. Valentine-Richards and Mr. 
		C. A. Elliott roused it to life and even produced some funds which they 
		had carefully preserved since the club had ceased to meet. From that meeting, 
		when there were less than a dozen members, to this day when there are 
		well over a hundred, the club has grown and altered. Many changes have 
		taken place. A careful examination of the minute books will show that 
		there were once two lady members. This threatened invasion was promptly 
		averted by the statesman-like if ungallant actions of Mr. Elliott. The 
		early meetings were of a very informal nature, but with the increase in 
		numbers of the club they have become rather more formal, although that 
		tendency has been checked as far as possible. For the same reason it is 
		now usual to &quot;import&quot; most of the climbers who talk to the dub, 
		whereas some few years ago the officers used to supply most of the talks, 
		which were given about twice in each term. </P>
	  <P>Without 
		making invidious distinctions it would be impossible to single out individuals 
		for thanks, but some, who have gone away from Cambridge, must be mentioned. 
		Mr. Valentine-Richards’ part has already been described, and its value 
		cannot be overestimated. Mr. Elliott, too, is a modern father of the dub 
		and his claim to our thanks rests on more than his last-mentioned action. 
		During his years up here after the War, Mr. G. Winthrop Young took great 
		interest in the C.U.M.C., and acted as encourager-in-chief, a most important 
		part, to many climbers of our &quot;golden age&quot;; the meetings in 
		his house have become legendary. Many more there are who ought to be mentioned, 
		but who probably would rather not, to whom the C.U.M.C. owes a great deal. 
		</P>
	  <P>A club which 
		changes completely every three years is liable to ups and downs, but the 
		C.U.M.C. has been exceptionally lucky in this respect. Its presidents 
		have been keen on their job, its secretaries hard-working, its treasurers 
		shrewd and grasping, and there has always been the backing of the dons. 
		</P>
	  <P>From holding 
		two talks in each term, the C.U.M.C. has now achieved the dignity of three 
		or four lectures, which are always reasonably well attended, sometimes 
		overwhelmingly, and for some reason the elect of the climbing world are 
		always very kind to us in the way of giving up their time to speak in 
		Cambridge. The journal, if it has not improved in quality, has become 
		a hardy biennial of pure breed, and if our meetings have become more formal, 
		our publication has become less so. In addition to the lectures there 
		have always been informal meetings and such enterprises as Wedderburn’s 
		Sunday evenings and van Noorden’s mountaineering breakfasts of happy memory. 
		</P>
	  <P>But the 
		most important side of the club’s activities lies in its meets at home 
		and abroad. Rock-climbing meets have been held at Easter in the Lakes 
		and Wales for many years, and Scotland has recently been included. The 
		numbers attending these meets have been fairly constant, between twenty 
		and thirty for the past few years and, indeed, they cannot really get 
		any larger with comfort. The standard of climbing is as high as it ever 
		was; the average person is made into a leader on &quot;difficults&quot; 
		after his first meet, but unfortunately it seems to be chiefly those in 
		their third years at Cambridge who brave the unknown perils of a meet. 
		The first C.U.M.C. meet in the Alps was held in 1923, and there has been 
		an Alpine meet every year since then. Every one of these meets has been 
		strictly &quot;guideless,&quot; not even senior members of the club acting 
		as leaders, and the places visited have been Les Evettes (Central Graians), 
		Entre-deux-Eaux (Vanoise), Arolla, Tyrol (&Ouml;tztal and Zillertal), 
		Turtagr&ouml; (Norway), and Saas Fee. An innovation was a ski-mountaineering 
		meet held last March in the Bernese Oberland. The number of members attending 
		these meets has been between ten and fifteen. Although they were started 
		for the sake of economy they now form a useful school of guideless climbing. 
		</P>
	  <P>The individual 
		achievements of members of the C.U.M.C. cannot be enlarged upon. It is 
		sufficient to mention our pride in the large part which Cambridge climbers 
		have played in the recent Everest Expedition. On the whole a record difficult 
		to live up to! Returning from the general to the particular, Aodh MacBaph 
		is the <I>nom de plume</I> of E. A. Balfour (Caius). The poem is, of course, 
		based on incidents of the Easter Meet, 1932, but I must hasten to point 
		out that the heroes stand in no fixed relation to members who attended 
		that meet. I am immensely indebted to J. R. Fearon (Trinity Hall), who 
		has shouldered all responsibility for the advertisements of this production. 
		I also want. to thank E. A. M. Wedderburn, who collected most of the material, 
		and various other friends who have helped me considerably at one time 
		or .html. </P>
