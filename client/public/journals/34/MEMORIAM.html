	  <H2>ALFRED VALENTINE VALENTINE-RICHARDS</H2>
	  <P><IMG SRC="VALEN.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="431" ALT="A.V. Valentine-Richards" ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER="1">BY 
		the death of Alfred Valentine Valentine-Richards Cambridge has lost a 
		distinguished mountaineer and a man of great kindliness. More than anyone 
		else he helped to bring the Cambridge University Mountaineering Club to 
		its present state of vigorous efficiency, and he may well be called the 
		founder of the less vigorous though equally flourishing Cambridge Alpine 
		Club.</P>
	  <P>Valentine-Richards 
		came up to Christ’s from Uppingham in 1885. He was fourth Wrangler in 
		1888 and took a first class in the Theological Tripos in 1890. For a short 
		time after taking his degree he did some lecturing work in Cambridge, 
		and then for a number of years lived at his home in Wimbledon and spent 
		much time abroad. It was during these years that he acquired his skill 
		as a mountaineer and amassed his wide knowledge of Alpine matters. He 
		returned to Christ’s as a fellow and lecturer in 1904 and became dean 
		in 1906. </P>
	  <P>We of a 
		younger generation who knew him in the years that followed, were well 
		aware of the vast storehouse of mountain knowledge that was his, but it 
		was only rarely that he spoke of his own climbing exploits. It is a pity 
		that there is so little in print about his early climbing expeditions. 
		His articles in the<I> Alpine Journal</I> are masterpieces of accurate 
		information and detail; but one could wish that he to whom the mountains 
		made such an appeal had left more on record of the joy and feeling that 
		they aroused in him. </P>
	  <P>It requires 
		a particular bent of mind to keep pace with and co-ordinate the various 
		developments of Alpinism. Valentine- Richards possessed the necessary 
		critical capacity and pains- taking accuracy in a high degree, and when 
		the Alpine Club decided to bring<I> Ball’s Alpine Guide</I> up to date 
		as a memorial to its first president, it fell to Valentine-Richards to 
		take in hand the general editorship of<I> The Central Alps,</I> Part I. 
		Anyone familiar with this great guide – the model perhaps for all mountain 
		guide-books – will appreciate the immense amount of labour that must have 
		gone to its re-editing. Valentine- Richards began his task in 1901 and 
		his volume was published. </P>
	  <P>In the years 
		that followed his return to Cambridge he became the friend of generation 
		after generation of under- graduates. He continued to spend his summers 
		in the Alps and often took undergraduates with him. He also took parties 
		to North Wales and the Lake District. He was the ideal com- panion as 
		all who have memories of those delightful holidays will agree. His activity 
		and energy amazed the younger members of these parties. Often the expeditions 
		were pro- longed to surprisingly late hours and it was long after night- 
		fall when we tramped back over the fells after the rock- climbing had 
		been done. It was a point of his never to be benighted, and I think he 
		succeeded in this, though I remember one day getting down to Langdale 
		at 3 a.m., after some wet climbs on Scafell and a delay of several hours 
		on the Pike in mist and complete blackness. To all who climb the rocks 
		must become a measure of the passing of years, and in those days Valentine-Richards 
		preferred not to lead rock climbs; but there could never have been a more 
		helpful and patient second on a rope. Sometimes, perhaps, too much patience 
		was demanded of him, as on one occasion when a leader in order to renew 
		his attack on the top block of the Napes Needle adopted a surprising and 
		rapid, though perhaps not uncontrolled, slithering descent to the shoulder 
		below. I think it was good advice of Valentine-Richards to leave the Needle 
		for that day and to pass on to the Needle Ar&ecirc;te. </P>
	  <P>In the War 
		years there was the inevitable break in his visits to the hills. He turned 
		his activities to the Boy Scouts, and scouting became one of his chief 
		interests throughout his latter years – indeed, he carried on his camping 
		with scouts when it seemed almost impossible that his health was good 
		enough to stand it. </P>
	  <P>When Cambridge 
		revived after the War Valentine-Richards at once got together a nucleus 
		to reform the Cambridge University Mountaineering Club. Numbers rapidly 
		increased until by degrees the club has reached the big membership it 
		now has. When numbers were smaller the club frequently met in Valentine-Richards’s 
		rooms in Christ’s. He was the perfect host for such gatherings, which 
		were rather more informal and certainly less ambitious as regards discourses 
		than is now the case. It was a great privilege that the club should have 
		held so many of its meetings in his delightful rooms. There was much in 
		the surroundings there – his Alpine books, his pictures, his fine collections 
		of furniture and china which conduced, more perhaps than one was conscious 
		of at the time, to make these meetings so successful. I know it was a 
		great happiness to Valentine-Richards in the days when his climbing career 
		was drawing to a close to have so many young mountaineers coming to him. 
		His help was inestimable. The club is largely his achievement and is the 
		outcome of bis mountain knowledge and experience. </P>
	  <P>He had a 
		few summers in the Alps in the post-War years. Once he was at Saas Fee, 
		where he was particularly pleased with what he was still able to do, and 
		.html year he went to the Belv&eacute;d&egrave;re (Furka); but in 1924 
		when he last visited Kandersteg it became clear that he was no longer 
		equal to the exertion of long mountain days. </P>
	  <P>The photograph 
		which accompanies these lines was taken in April 1923,.at the top of the 
		slabs on Carnedd y Filiast, the last spring holiday in which Valentine-Richards 
		did any rock climbing. </P>
	  <P>During the 
		remaining years of his life he suffered from an illness which made it 
		increasingly difficult for him to get about. However, he was active in 
		lecturing and other Cambridge duties until his death last April at the 
		age of 66. </P>
	  <P>In what 
		I have written I have had Valentine-Richards the mountaineer in view. 
		Others will remember him in other ways, with affection as a most approachable 
		dean of their College, or for his scholarship in theological matters. 
		Some will recall him as a connoisseur and collector of china, glass, and 
		silver, and for his keen interest in gardening and flowers. He had wide 
		interests which led him into many pleasant paths, and his joy in the mountains 
		and his great love for them inspired him in all that he did. C. M. S.

	  <H2>HENRY GEORGE 
		WATKINS </H2>
	  <P>HON. TREASURER 
		OF THE CLUB, 1927 – 28 </P>
	  <P>WATKINS 
		began his climbing career while still at school at Lancing, going to the 
		Lake District in April 1924 with one of the masters, Mr. E. B. Gordon. 
		Both were beginners, and his companion emphasizes that of the two it was 
		Watkins who provided the necessary enterprise, chose climbs, and acted 
		as leader. Opportunities in the Alps came the same year, when he was at 
		Chamonix with his parents. Mr. Gordon joined him, and together they climbed 
		the Grands Charmoz and the Aiguille de l’M. In 1925 he was again in Switzerland 
		and made some climbs, among them the traverse of the Petite Dent de Veisivi, 
		with Emile Gysin, a student of nineteen who hoped to qualify in time for 
		his guide’s certificate. Later in the same year Watkins was chamois hunting 
		with his father in Tyrol, and had a narrow escape, falling 150 ft. down 
		steep rocks. </P>
	  <P>His big 
		Alpine year was 1926, when he spent over six weeks almost entirely with 
		Gysin. Watkins wrote out a list of his expeditions in Gysin’s diary, from 
		which it appears that they followed a more or less high level route from 
		Chamonix to Zermatt, the order of events being roughly: Aiguille du Moine, 
		Aiguille de la Pers&eacute;v&eacute;rance, Aiguille de la Neuvaz, Pointe 
		des Amethystes, Aiguilles du Tour, Aiguilles Marbr&eacute;es, traverse 
		of Mont Gr&eacute;pillon and Mont Dolent, Grand St. Bernard, Mont Velan, 
		Col des Maisons Blanches, La Ruinette, and various passes via Arolla and 
		Zinal to St. Nicolas and Zermatt; traverse of Monte Rosa from B&eacute;temps 
		Hut to Macugnaga, and back by New Weissthor and Cima di Jazzi; Aiguille 
		de la Tsa and Pigne d’Arolla; and later on Mont Blanc and the Grands Charmoz. 
		</P>
	  <P>My own friendship 
		with Watkins dates from the spring of 1926, and our mutual interest was 
		in Arctic rather than Alpine matters. Watkins received his Arctic inspiration 
		from R. E. Priestley’s lectures, given at Cambridge intermittently from 
		1923 to 1930, a course which it is hoped may be revived again soon in 
		some form or other. I had planned an Arctic expedition for 1927 with Watkins 
		as a member, but when it was postponed Watkins immediately decided to 
		lead a party himself. He was then twenty. He chose Edge Island in East 
		Spitsbergen as his objective, and chartered the motor sloop<I> Heimen</I> 
		of Troms&ouml; for his party of nine. They explored and mapped parts of 
		Edge Island, and found unexpectedly that the interior was not completely 
		ice-covered as formerly thought. This caused an important change in Watkins’s 
		plans; he had hoped to sledge across the island, but the actual crossing 
		of the interior was in the end made on foot. </P>
	  <P>On his return 
		he decided almost immediately to visit Labrador in 1928, and to remain 
		over the winter. His companion was J. M. Scott, and together they learnt 
		how to travel by canoe and dog sledge. Watkins returned from his training 
		year in Labrador unusually well-equipped for extended Arctic explorations. 
		</P>
	  <P>Plans for 
		a great Greenland Expedition were made, and in July 1930 Watkins took 
		a party of fourteen, constituting the British Arctic Air Route Expedition, 
		to winter on the east coast near Angmagssalik. Several hundred miles of 
		the coast were explored in detail for the first time, partly by ship, 
		partly from the air. On one of the flights Watkins sighted an entirely 
		new range of mountains in 69°N. latitude, the highest in the Arctic, estimating 
		their height at 12,000-15,000 ft. (Last year – 1933 – this range was actually 
		flown over by Colonel Lindberg, who assigns a definite height of 13,000 
		ft.) The Greenland ice cap was crossed by two sledge parties in the early 
		summer of 1931, one to Ivigtut, the other to Holsteinborg. There had also 
		been an attempt in spring to climb Mount Forel, over 11,000 ft., L. R. 
		Wager leading a party to within about 700 ft. of the summit. Watkins concluded 
		the explorations by making a hazardous boat journey with two companions 
		round Cape Farewell to Julianehaab. On his return he was awarded the gold 
		medal of the Royal Geographical Society as a tribute to his leadership 
		of the most important Arctic expedition which had gone from this country 
		since 1875. </P>
	  <P>Watkins’s 
		last expedition was made a year later when he returned to East Greenland, 
		this time with only three companions, to complete the necessary groundwork 
		for the Arctic air route. In August 1932, a few weeks after arriving on 
		the coast, he was drowned while hunting from his kayak; no details are 
		known, except that some chance must have made it necessary for him to 
		take to the water, and that he was overpowered by the cold before being 
		able to regain his kayak. </P>
	  <P>Watkins 
		must have made an ideal climbing companion. Mr. Gordon says of him that 
		he "was an enterprising climber and cautious, as I suppose the best climbers 
		always are." Gysin refers particularly to his powers of endurance, to 
		his prudence, and to his aptitude for rapid decision when necessary. </P>
	  <P>These are 
		among the special qualities demanded of an Arctic leader, and Watkins 
		succeeded in leadership in a marked degree. He chose his men well and 
		trusted them, giving them a wide latitude in all they did. He was always 
		ready willing at any time to modify his plans as hindrances occurred or 
		new opportunities appeared. These were some of the secrets of his success, 
		which places him in the front rank of Polar leaders, with McClintock, 
		with Shackleton, and with Nansen. J. M. W. </P>
	  <H2>JOHN DAVID 
		BEST </H2>
	  <P>DAVID BEST, 
		who joined the club as soon as he came up to Queens’ in1928, and was one 
		of its most active supporters, was Secretary in his last year (1930-31). 
		</P>
	  <P>As a boy 
		he had lived in the Pennines and been at school al Kendal, so that he 
		had ample opportunity of taking advantage of the fells that attracted 
		him so much, and he was lucky enough to be able to begin rock-climbing 
		much sooner than most people. His enthusiasm for climbing was as boundlessly 
		ambitious as it was for anything else that interested him. He always aimed 
		at something better and more exciting, but not without fully appreciating 
		what he was actually able to do; probably he enjoyed, more than any of 
		his later climbing, his early expeditions from school to Sleddale, where 
		he explored almost unknown crags on summer half-holidays. </P>
	  <P>As a result 
		of his remarkable keenness, by the time he came up to Cambridge, Best 
		was one of the most capable and agile rock-climbers in the club, and it 
		was only the difficulty of his going out to the Alps more often that prevented 
		him from becoming as accomplished a mountaineer as he was a rock- climber. 
		He was a fearless climber, who always took it for granted that he could 
		get up anything that confronted him, but he never gave the impression 
		that he was climbing near his margin of safety, and his own confidence 
		inspired unexpected success in his more timid companions. </P>
	  <P>After taking 
		honours in Mathematics and Engineering, Best worked for the Gaslight and 
		Coke Company before joining the Air Force, and it was only a year after 
		he went down that he was killed in a flying accident. His early death 
		has robbed us, his climbing friends, of a delightful companion and has 
		spoilt, almost before it had begun, a mountaineering career which showed 
		every sign of being a very remarkable one. C. B. </P>
	  <H2>GEORGE 
		HEWLETT DAWES EDWARDS </H2>
	  <P>HEWLETT 
		EDWARDS came up to St. John’s in 1931, and the following year proceeded 
		to Westcott House, with the intention of taking orders. He came of a family 
		whose members have all shown a natural aptitude for climbing and, indeed, 
		he might well have been one of the most brilliant climbers of his day, 
		had he taken the sport seriously, for he combined just that right amount 
		of dash and restraint which form the essential make-up of a great leader. 
		His work at Cambridge, however, precluded all but occasional visits to 
		the mountains. </P>
	  <P>It was when 
		returning from one of these visits that he was involved in a motor-cycle 
		accident, and received head injuries to which he succumbed some three 
		hours later. The previous afternoon he had made a solitary descent of 
		the Devil’s Kitchen, no slight achievement, as those familiar with Welsh 
		rocks will admit. </P>
	  <P>Although 
		he had been a member of the C.U.M.C. since he first came to the University, 
		he had attended only one meet, that at Helyg in January 1933, and few 
		members of the club knew him well. Only those of us who were his intimate 
		friends and enjoyed his delightful companionship can realize how great 
		a loss the club has suffered in the death of a man who was so sound in 
		every way. S. B. D. </P>
