	  <P> ON the evening 
	  of August 23, 1932, I was at the little Trift Hotel above Zermatt with my 
	  friend, A. E. Roovers of New York. It had been a perfect day, but at four 
	  o’clock in the afternoon clouds had blown over from Italy, and although 
	  the weather was somewhat doubtful, we had walked up to the Trift with the 
	  intention of carrying out our plan of traversing the Wellenkuppe and Obergabelhorn. 
	  Our guide, Felix Julen, joined us at 7 o’clock and by the time we had finished 
	  dinner, the Wellenkuppe was hidden in clouds, presenting a most depressing 
	  sight.</P>

			Zermatt Peaks from the Rothorn </DIV>  
	  
	  <P>At midnight 
		we were aroused by a violent thunderstorm which was followed by torrential 
		rain. The only thing to be done was to sleep and forget all about mountain. 
		To our surprise we were called at 5 o’clock in the morning by Felix, who 
		said it was fine enough to try the Wellenkuppe at any rate. After a hurried 
		breakfast we were ready to start, and the five other parties at the Trift, 
		more or less asleep, turned out to watch three madmen start out on a trip 
		to the clouds. </P>
	  <P>As we went 
		quickly up the steep track which leads to the Trift glacier the Wellenkuppe 
		once more disappeared for a time in the clouds. It seemed rather foolish 
		to have started, but the weather had tempted a start and one might as 
		well go on. Once on the Trift glacier we put on the rope, for there was 
		some fresh snow which disguised the crevasses, Mounting towards the Triftjoch, 
		we bore round to the left in a semi-circle, and climbed up towards the 
		southern rocks of the Wellenkuppe. In one place there had been a recent 
		avalanche and in crossing this the snow came up to the waistline. After 
		this hard work the rocks were reached, when we stopped for a short rest. 
		The clouds were swirling around in gusts, and every other moment one could 
		catch a glimpse of the Trift far below. After a scramble up the rocks 
		we reached the snow ridge leading to the flat top of the Wellenkuppe at 
		10 a.m., which was exactly four hours from the Trift. </P>
	  <P>After a 
		brief consultation we decided to go on for a bit. Although one could not 
		see more than 80 yards, the temperature was quite warm. The snow was deep, 
		and as we made our way down to the slight col between the Wellenkuppe 
		and the Obergabelhorn we sank up to our knees. The ridge is narrow with 
		a cornice on the left side and a very steep slope going into the vertical 
		on the right side, so that a great deal of care was required. </P>
	  <P>It was now 
		snowing hard, but still there was no wind. The silence was profound, disturbed 
		abruptly every now and again by the roar of some unseen avalanche. The 
		clouds gave an eerie effect; now we could see a ridge on the Zinal Rothorn, 
		then a snow slope on the Dent Blanche, but could never see a whole mountain 
		at a time. The sensation of groping one’s way up this seemingly interminable 
		ridge was peculiar, because with a strictly limited vision one felt as 
		if one was standing still, with the ridge moving, but never gaining altitude. 
		Time seemed to be standing still, especially as the snow had stopped my 
		wrist-watch, for at every step one took the ice-axe sank right up to its 
		head. And still the snow kept on falling softly. </P>
	  <P>Quite suddenly 
		the Great Gendarme loomed into view, as a ship suddenly appears in a thick 
		sea fog. The Gendarme was thickly covered with ice, but on the upper part 
		a fixed rope was attached. The top of the Gendarme is narrow, and one 
		has to drop down steeply on the other side to regain the ridge again. 
		The Gendarme was a pleasant diversion, but we were soon once again toiling 
		up the snow ridge, which was now getting steeper. A subtle icy breeze 
		had appeared too, which made one chilly. </P>
	  <P>The snow 
		began to give way to rocks and one had to scramble up some icy slabs which 
		demanded care, while one’s hands became very cold and the rope had also 
		become stiff and white with snow. The scrambling continued till quite 
		suddenly we reached the peak of the Obergabelhorn, and as we crossed the 
		Gabel the clouds rolled back on the Zinal side, and after one or two moments 
		of hesitation, the sun broke through and began to warm us. Lunch was quite 
		a pleasant affair with a perfect view of the Zinal valley, the Dent Blanche 
		and a vivid view of the Z’Mutt ridge of the Matterhorn, although Zermatt 
		and the other peaks were hidden in clouds. </P>
	  <P>At half-past 
		one in the afternoon we started to descend the Arben ridge, which tumbled 
		down steeply in a series of huge red, rocky steps. The rocks were dry, 
		and with the sun beating down one was inclined to linger, and for this 
		reason our progress was slow. Every now and again we used the double rope. 
		Roovers was swearing in gentle American because he had leftt his quarter-plate 
		camera at the Trift, and Felix was swearing gently because he wanted to 
		get back to Zermatt for his dinner. We stopped a short time for tea, and 
		then left the ridge and dropped down towards the Arben glacier. On the 
		glacier, after a little bout of step cutting, we descended quickly. We 
		stopped to unrope. Behind the Obergabelhorn reared into the sky, bronzed 
		by the setting sun. We turned our backs and rushed down the moraine from 
		the Arben glacier into the Z’Mutt valley, with the Matterhorn towering 
		above us. We joined the path which goes to the Sch&ouml;nb&uuml;hl hut 
		and hurried on towards Zermatt in the shadowy dusk, the silence broken 
		only by the rhythmic tread of our boots. At the little village of Z’Mutt 
		we stopped for five minutes for a glass of cold milk with a liqueur glass 
		of brandy poured in it to take the chill off. Zermatt was already alight 
		as we came across the meadows below the Gorner gorge, and, as 8 o’clock 
		was striking on the church bells, we said good-night to Felix, exactly 
		fourteen hours after leaving the Trift. </P>
