	  	  <H2>THE HIMALAYA </H2>
	  <H3>THE GANGOTRI GLACIER EXPEDITION </H3>
	  <H4>C. B. M. WARREN,<I> Emmanuel</I></H4>
	  <P>Towards 
		the close of 1932 the plans and arrangements of the Pallis expedition 
		to the Gangotri Glacier in the Garwal Himalaya were already well advanced, 
		and the personnel had been completed. The expedition was to be run as 
		far as possible on Alpine lines: that is to say – we were to do our own 
		carrying on the mountains (instead of being carried up by our porters); 
		and in general the similarities rather than the differences between mountaineering 
		in the Alps and in the Himalayas were to be emphasized. </P>
	  <P>Our plans 
		were to visit the Gangotri Glacier, the tributaries of which were to be 
		explored as far as proved possible, and to climb some of the peaks which 
		surround this, one of’ the longest glaciers in the Himalayas. No particular 
		mountain was mentioned in this respect for the simple reason that so few 
		people have ever visited the district, and so little is known about the 
		peaks there; but perhaps some of us, being &quot;snobs for altitude,&quot; 
		had visions of attacking Kunaling, the highest peak in the district. As 
		soon as the &quot;monsoon&quot; hit us here on the southern edge of the 
		Great Himalaya Range, some of the party were to fly away northward, over 
		one of the high passes, into the monsoon-free mountains round the upper 
		reaches of the Sutlij river. </P>
	  <P>On May 10th, 
		our party, consisting of Marco Pallis (leader), Ted Hicks (C.U.M.C.), 
		Collin Kirkus, Richard Nicholson, and Charles Warren (C.U.M.C.), set out 
		from Mussoorie with sixty- seven Garwalie coolies carrying our stores 
		and equipment. We took the hill path to the Bhagirathi valley which brings 
		one down to the river near a village called Nari on the map; this way 
		took us over two high cols in the foothills from which we had incomparable 
		views on to the Gangotri peaks. Thenceforth we travelled along the great 
		pilgrim route as far as the place called Gangotri. At Harsil the transport 
		had to be reorganized to some extent, some of our Garwalie porters left 
		us to return to Mussoorie, and we had to engage new men to replace them 
		from amongst the local Jahd population, which was just then beginning 
		to find its way back to the upper valleys after wintering down near the 
		plains. On May 22nd we were again on the move, and the next day, after 
		passing through that astonishing place the Gangotri Gorge, which had so 
		much impressed Captain Hodgson and the early travellers in these parts, 
		we reached Gangotri. The path ends here (only a few of the more hardy 
		pilgrims penetrating beyond Gangotri as far as the actual source of the 
		Ganges, to the place called Gau-Much), and our stages in consequence became 
		shorter. But by May 28th, in spite of a slight difficulty with the porters, 
		we had established a base-camp on the moraine at the snout of the Gangotri 
		glacier. Here, in accordance with our plans, we retained four men – two 
		Jahds and two Garwalies; the others we sent back. </P>
	  <P>Having established 
		base-camp between the ice-hummocks on the snout of the glacier at an altitude 
		of about 14,500 ft., the first days here were spent in learning the geography 
		of the place. Two of us travelled up the main glacier on skis; the others 
		explored two lateral glaciers which drain into the Gangotri glacier near 
		base-camp. </P>
	  <P>On June 
		4th and 5th all the climbing parties were away from base-camp. Pallis, 
		with one of the porters, went to a peak on the right bank of the glacier; 
		Dan Singh, the porter, was unable to go beyond the col so Pallis climbed 
		the summit ridge alone. This peak is about 20,000 ft. high. Hicks and 
		Kirkus climbed a 20,000 ft, mountain on the left bank of the glacier near 
		base-camp. And at this time Nicholson and I spent two days exploring the 
		lateral glacier, which flows in an east to west direction, and which joins 
		the Gangotri glacier immediately to the north of the first Satapant peak. 
		We discovered that the glacier was the one down which the Smythe party 
		had looked; and we were able to identify Birnie’s col and the peak which 
		he mistook for the first Satapant. Furthermore, we made a sketch map of 
		an extensive new glacier basin which is not recorded on the map. </P>
	  <P>After these 
		preliminary explorations, Hicks, Kirkus, and I set out to attack a high 
		snowy mountain of about 22,000 ft. We took two of the men to help us to 
		carry enough equipment to establish an advanced base-camp near the mountain; 
		then we started pushing bivouac-camps up the mountain-side. There were 
		three bivouac- camps in all, and we succeeded in reaching an altitude 
		of over21,000 ft. on this our first really high climb, before we had to 
		retreat because of bad weather and lack of food for further attempts on 
		the summit. On this mountain we were able to climb to Camp 2 at 19,480 
		ft. on skis. </P>
	  <P>During the 
		next two days I remained up at advanced-base; the other two had gone on 
		down to base. On June 15th I was rejoined here by Kirkus, who brought 
		up fresh food supplies and the plane- table and surveying apparatus. Now 
		we had both decided independently that there was a possible route up the 
		second Satapant peak from this side, so we decided then and there to postpone 
		the proposed surveying trip up the glacier and to climb the Satapant peak 
		instead. </P>
	  <P>There are 
		four Satapant peaks, and they all spring from the ridge which forms the 
		right-hand, or easterly, retaining wall of the Gangotri glacier; they 
		are numbered from north to south. Of these peaks the third is the highest 
		and is over 23,000 ft., but there is no obvious route up it from this 
		side. The second peak is a smooth rock wall on this side, but a rib or 
		spur runs up from the glacier to join the south ridge high up on the mountain, 
		and it was up this subsidiary ridge that we hoped to find a way to the 
		top. </P>
	  <P>On June 
		15th, laden to the extent of nearly 30 lb., we crossed the glacier and 
		set foot on the mountain. On the 17th we put a camp on the main south 
		ridge of the mountain after spending two nights on the spur lower down. 
		This camp was at the foot of a high tower on the ridge. On the 18th we 
		looked out on the first of the monsoon clouds, then we set to work on 
		the base of the tower, which was exceptionally steep. The last pitch on 
		the tower lay up a vertical corner, the rocky cornice of which was garnished 
		with a pile of loose stones and actually overhung; it was surmounted by 
		Kirkus, who here did a brilliant piece of rock-climbing. The real difficulties 
		of the ascent were over and from the top of the tower we quickly reached 
		the narrow snow crest which was the summit. </P>
	  <P>Meanwhile 
		the other party had been at work in the new-found glacier basin trying 
		to make a route up the first Satapant peak, but the early advent of the 
		monsoon put an end to their efforts. Just before their attack on the Satapant 
		peak, Hicks and Nicholson had made the ascent of a very difficult peak, 
		well over 20,000 ft. high, near the base-camp. From the summit of this 
		mountain they were able to discern what seemed to be a possible way up 
		the Kedarnath peak, a discovery which may be of considerable importance 
		to future visitors to the district. </P>
	  <P>The advent 
		of the monsoon put a stop to all further climbing, so we gradually vacated 
		the base-camp and moved down to Harsil to recuperate our wasted bodies. 
		</P>

		Liu Purguil</DIV>
	  <P>At Harsil, 
		Hicks and Kirkus left us to return home. Then, after a proper rest, we 
		set out to reach the Sutlij valley and Liu Purguil, the highest mountain 
		in that district. On July 16th we crossed the 18,000 ft. Nela pass to 
		reach the Baspa valley, which we followed down to its junction with the 
		Sutlij gorge; then we moved up the Sutlij as far as the point where it 
		is joined by the Spiti river, and on August 2nd reached Nako, which was 
		our base of operations for the attempt on Liu Purguil. On August 11th 
		we reached the summit of the north peak of the mountain in distinctly 
		bad weather, and instead of enjoying the view into the forbidden land 
		of Tibet as we had hoped to do, we were chased from the top by the storm. 
		And thus ended the final ascent made on the expedition. </P>

	  <H3>THE CAMBRIDGE 
		EXPEDITION TO VATNAJOKULL, JUNE-AUGUST 1932 </H3>
	  <H4>B. B. ROBERTS,<I> 
		Emmanuel</I> </H4>
	  <P>Tazaz are 
		still some parts of Europe that have not been thoroughly explored. Perhaps 
		the least accessible is Vatnaj&ouml;kull, the largest ice-cap in Iceland, 
		situated in the south-western corner of the island and covering an area 
		of over 3,400 square miles. This great ice-sheet had been crossed five 
		times before 1932, but, owing to the extremely unpleasant weather conditions, 
		little scientific work had been done, and the existing maps were inaccurate 
		and very misleading. This ice-cap and the desert region of Odadahraun 
		to the north were the areas chosen for an expedition from Cambridge last 
		summer. </P>
	  <DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="ICELAND.jpg" WIDTH="388" HEIGHT="293" ALT="Vatnaj&ouml;kull" BORDER="1"><BR>
		Vatnaj&ouml;kull, Iceland</DIV>
	  <P>The party 
		consisted of six members: F. W. Anderson (geologist and zoologist), University 
		College, Southampton; J. A. Beckett (surveyor), Sidney Sussex, Cambridge; 
		P. Falk (botanist), King’s; W. L. S. Fleming (geologist), Trinity Hall; 
		W. V. Lewis (seismologist and surveyor), Caius; and B. B. Roberts (ornithologist), 
		Emmanuel, leader. </P>
	  <P>We went 
		out with two main objects – to try and make a double crossing of the ice-cap 
		by sledge and ski, and to carry out a geo- graphical and biological survey 
		of two areas: one in the central desert of Iceland north of Vatnaj&ouml;kull, 
		and the other in the narrow coastal strip between the ice-cap and the 
		sea on the south coast. </P>
	  <P>The Expedition 
		sailed from Hull on June 21st on board the fishing trawler<I> Lord Balfour 
		of Burleigh,</I> and landed at Hornafjordur, in south-east Iceland, four 
		days later. Our first business was a heavy one, and consisted in unpacking 
		the whole of our belongings, apportioning the provisions into equal eight-day 
		allowances, and getting our loads as far as possible ship-shape for transport 
		on pack-homes, and later on sledges. </P>
	  <P>If one uses 
		the ordinary methods of travel, it is impossible to spend more than two 
		or three days, at the most, in Central Iceland, as there is no grass for 
		the ponies to eat. We therefore decided to dispense with ponies as soon 
		as we reached Vatnaj&ouml;kull, and to haul the sledges ourselves across 
		the 45 miles of ice to the central desert, and then back again. </P>
	  <P>Our cavalcade 
		of twenty-eight pack ponies wandered slowly out of Hornafjordur on June 
		27th. Three days later we reached the ice edge at a height of 3,400 ft. 
		and sent back the ponies to the coast. </P>
	  <P>We had brought 
		with us two 11-ft. Norwegian sledges, each weighing about 740lb. when 
		fully loaded. Our three-men harnesses were made of canvas with straps 
		over each shoulder and a strap round the waist. To begin with we found 
		sledging distinctly arduous, owing to the steep upward slope, the continual 
		crevasses, and a thawing snow surface; for, besides scientific equipment, 
		the sledges were loaded with food for fifty days. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		day we covered only 2 miles, and pitched our tents in a blizzard which 
		kept us there for five days. It was most humiliating to be held up like 
		this right at the start, On July 5th we crawled out of the funnel-shaped 
		entrances of the tents and struck camp for .html move northwards. Two 
		days later we reached the worst part of the uphill climb, a steep bank 
		some 500 ft. or 600 ft. high. All six of us harnessed to one sledge and 
		eventually we got everything to the top in relays. Another snowstorm kept 
		us in our tents the following day and when we began sledging again the 
		newly fallen snow was so soft that we made little progress. During most 
		of our stay on Vatnaj&ouml;kull we were in a thick fog, and in order to 
		keep our compass bearing followed one .html, the second sledge party 
		signalling to the first if their tracks deviated from a straight course. 
		It is a strange sensation sledging in a fog over clean snow. There is 
		no horizon and the snow in the foreground merges into the sky without 
		any break, so that it is impossible to tell even if one is travelling 
		up or down hill, except by the drag on the traces. Under these circumstances 
		sledging is most monotonous and one is fatigued rather by boredom than 
		physical weariness. </P>
	  <P>It took 
		us fifteen days to reach the northern edge of the ice, and there we discovered 
		and mapped a new mountain range extending 8 miles into the ice, and rising 
		to a height of 5,600 ft. We spent a fortnight in the central desert and, 
		before returning, planned the only bit of serious climbing of the whole 
		trip, the ascent of Kverkfjoll Eystri (Eastern Gorge Mountain), our new 
		mountain range. However, we were doomed to disappointment. Another five-day 
		blizzard confined us to our tents once more and, when the weather cleared, 
		our food supply was running low and we could not risk further delay. </P>
	  <P>The weather 
		during our return was excellent. There was a firm frozen crust on the 
		newly fallen snow, and we recrossed the ice-cap slightly further to the 
		west, reaching the coast in only three and a half days. This illustrates 
		rather well how difficult it is to estimate the time it will take to travel 
		from one place to .html on an Icelandic ice-cap. We had completed most 
		of the work we had set out to accomplish and returned to Hornafjordur 
		by pony once more. Unfortunately it proved impossible to return to England 
		by trawler, so we were forced to charter the only motor-boat in thc place, 
		an open craft some 30 ft. long, and set out for the Westmann Islands, 
		200 miles away. A bad Atlantic gale blew up and it was only with the most 
		extraordinary good luck that we reached port after twenty-eight hours’ 
		storm, At the Westmann Islands we were picked up by the steamer<I> Godafoss,</I> 
		on her way from Reykjavik to Hull, and reached England on August 20th.

	  <H3>THE OXFORD 
		UNIVERSITY ARCTIC EXPEDITION, 1933</H3>
	  <H4>R. H. S. 
		ROBERTSON,<I> Caius</I> </H4>
	  <P>The Oxford 
		University Arctic Expedition (1933) had good weather and a long season, 
		in which several new peaks were climbed. The following notes refer only 
		to climbs in which I took part as a member of the base-party. </P>
	  <P>Mount Pyramid, 
		an imposing peak just over 3,000 ft., forms the western side of Petunia 
		Bay, Ice Fjord. The last 200 ft. only are of interest after interminable 
		scree, because the capping of Cyathophyllum limestone is characteristically 
		eroded into vertical walls. The summit is reached by chimneys and cracks 
		held together by ice. Surfaces exposed to the sun are therefore dangerous. 
		From the summit-cairn we enjoyed a grand, cloudless view of the fjords, 
		mountains, and ice-cap. </P>
	  <P>In the Sassen 
		Valley, nearly all the mountains are trigonometrical points, but some, 
		such as Mount Trident, have a surprising character due to the Arctic weathering, 
		in that paper-shales, which in England would lie under a grassy hill, 
		here form bold cliff’s, treacherous to climb. In the survey of Dickson 
		Land, in which E. E. Mann, J. Brough, and I were engaged, many new peaks, 
		valleys, and glaciers were visited for the first tirne in the course of 
		our work, but none of them could compare in a romantic light with Mount 
		Citadel. Three maps, made previously from fair distances, marked the name 
		Mount Citadel, or the Citadel, in widely separated parts of North Dickson 
		Land. We set out to find the elusive and almost mythical mountain. </P>
	  <P>On the third 
		day’s walk up the Horbye Glacier we climbed to a col to see the view; 
		a handsome, lone, flat-topped mountain some miles to the north was unmistakably 
		our Citadel. That &quot;night&quot; we camped beside Red Lake under the 
		mountain, after difliculties in negotiating a high col-system with our 
		heavy packs, and owing to the steepness of the north-flowing, highly crevassed 
		glacier. During the day we had had to brew pemmican in the shelter of 
		some boulders for warmth and energy. </P>
	  <P>Rain delayed 
		an ascent for a day, and then the top was cloud-capped. The screes near 
		the top seemed to be abnormally tiring, especially for Brough, who was 
		concealing an internal trouble. There is a capping of limestone, similar 
		to that of Mount Pyramid, and the ice-filled gullies were difficult. A 
		toast in good whisky was welcome when we reached the top in a blast of 
		driven snow. My beard and deer-stalker were memorably festooned with icicles. 
		</P>
	  <P>I left Dickson 
		Land for a week to join a depot-laying sledge- party. After performing 
		this duty to our leader’s satisfaction, we had time and glorious weather 
		to climb a mountain, since called Mount Mawson, south of the Newton massif. 
		Glen, Hartley, and de Laszlo ski-ed, leaving me to try a direct climb 
		up an ever-steepening snow-gully. Small quartzite outcrops made a fall 
		undesirable. I noticed that avalanches were rare on that face. The process 
		of &quot;flogging down the cornice&quot; was new to me, and I never wish 
		to do it again, alone. The view was magnificent; the Stubendorff Range 
		seemed most inviting to the mountaineer. Mount Newton, 5,445 ft., is the 
		highest peak in the land, whilst the Mount Chernichev system and the Chydenius 
		Range have many notable peaks. Andr&eacute;e Land appeared to be of unusual 
		height owing to a mirage. The skiers arrived an hour later, but enjoyed 
		a quick run down. </P>
	  <P>Rock-climbing 
		in Spitsbergen is usually marred by frost-shattered rock and screes. Boots 
		are lacerated, and nails worn down in a short time. A protector for the 
		uppers would be a welcome invention. There is plenty of scope for excellent 
		ski-mountaineering on and near the ice-caps. </P>
	  <H2>NEWFOUNDLAND 
		</H2>
	  <H4>R. A. RUSSELL-SMITH,<I> 
		Clare</I> </H4>
	  <P>Last summer 
		I had the good fortune to be included in a party prospecting in Newfoundland. 
		We spent most of our time in the neighbourhood of the Long Range, which 
		runs for about 100 miles along the west coast. We were all very struck 
		by the great opportunity for unlimited rock-climbing in these mountains. 
		</P>
	  <P>The rivers 
		rising in the interior have broken through the range, which is never more 
		than 10 miles from the coast, in very steep- sided gorges. We visited 
		only one of these gorges, but we were very impressed by the enormous amount 
		of climbable rock. There appeared to be climbing of every type, but especially 
		slabs. There was one particular series of slabs we saw which made the 
		Idwals look like a postage stamp. </P>
	  <P>We saw several 
		other gorges from the coast, and even at that distance it was easy to 
		see large precipices and pinnacles. </P>
	  <P>Climbing 
		grounds would be fairly easy to reach, as there is a coastal steamer service, 
		which calls frequently at the villages situated at the river-mouths. Prom 
		the villages, the mountains could be quickly reached by canoe. </P>
	  <H2>UNITED 
		STATES </H2>
	  <H4>G. B. B. 
		M. SUTHERLAND,<I> Trinity</I> </H4>
	  <P>During the 
		summer of 1933 I visited a number of the United States National Parks, 
		of which the following offered very attractive climbing. </P>
	  <H3>GRAND TETON 
		NATIONAL PARK </H3>
	  <P>The Tetons 
		are a group of about six rather spectacular peaks just south of Yellowstone 
		Park in Wyoming. Their average height is 13,000 ft. and that of’ the surrounding 
		prairie some 6,500 ft. above sea-level. There are excellent camping grounds 
		(free) or log cabins ($1.50 per night) at Jenny Lake, within a mile or 
		so of the climbs. One of the park superintendents, Fritioff Fryxell, has 
		done many of the first ascents and will be found a most charming and helpful 
		person; his book,<I> The Teton Peaks and Their Ascents,</I> is invaluable 
		for this district. There is a Swiss guide, Petzoldt, who has also done 
		some very fine climbs on Grand Teton (13,700 ft.). I climbed Grand Teton 
		(guideless) with two Bulgarian students by the traditional route (there 
		are five other ones) – an interesting, sensational, but not difficult 
		rock climb. We also climbed Teewinot (12,000 ft.) by a new and moderately 
		difficult route, the final 1,000 ft. being up a narrow gully to the right 
		of the usual route. These climbs were done in August. </P>
	  <H3>GLACIER 
		NATIONAL PARK </H3>
	  <P>This park 
		is in Montana, just south of the Canadian border, its scenery being very 
		similar to that of the Canadian Rockies. The average height of the peaks 
		is 8,000-9,000 ft. and of the camping grounds and chalets 4000-7,000 ft. 
		There are innumerable rock climbs of every standard on good limestone 
		escarpments and peaks and many fine walks over high passes. I did one 
		of the latter (Swiftcurrent Pass, 7,500 ft.), climbing an escarpment called 
		the Garden Wall as a diversion<I> en route.</I> In spite of the name the 
		glaciers do not compare with Alpine ones, and although some snow climbs 
		are possible, in August at least, this park would probably be attractive 
		only to a rock climber. </P>
	  <H3>MT. RAINIER 
		NATIONAL PARK </H3>
	  <P>Mount Rainier 
		(14,408 ft.), the third highest mountain in the United States, is a volcanic 
		peak in the north-west state of Washing- ton. It is a snow climb at all 
		seasons. The possibilities of this mountain do not appear to have been 
		very thoroughly investigated. I did the regular route with the local guide, 
		Ben Thompson, starting from Paradise Camp (5,500 ft.) at 3 p.m., sleeping 
		a few hours in the Muir hut (10,000 ft.), and reaching the summit at 8 
		a.m. Used crampons all the way from Muir and no step-cutting was necessary. 
		Below Muir, ski could have been used with great advantage. Accommodation 
		is in a super-hotel ($2.50 per night) or two berth cabins ($1.00 per night).

		1932. First Ascent. </P>
	  <P>This route 
		lies up a ridge which runs from the glacier up to a point a few yards 
		south of the second peak from the south end of the main ridge. The ridge 
		is quite definite throughout and is quite narrow except for the steep 
		buttress in the middle. It is easily recognizable; at the bottom there 
		is a projection of light-coloured rock, shaped roughly like a pointing 
		hand, while a band of snow and ice runs obliquely upwards from north to 
		south, and finishes at the top of the ridge (cf. photo, X – X). </P>

		The Western Horungtinder from Mohn's Skar</DIV>
	  <P>Some difficulty 
		may be experienced in crossing from the ice to the rock, but a way ought 
		to be found in most years on the right (north) of the light-coloured projection. 
		We found no real difficulty here, but plenty of amusement. </P>
	  <P>Once on 
		the rock we followed it up for 30 ft. to a large, flat platform at the 
		foot of the ridge proper. Here we climbed a 6-ft. overhanging nose slightly 
		on the right and traversed a few feet to the right along a broad ledge, 
		and then continued up the ridge for 100 ft. to .html large level platform. 
		So far the climbing had been interesting, but not difficult. </P>
	  <P>Above this 
		point the ridge broadens into a buttress and steepens considerably. Slightly 
		to the right of the centre of this platform there are two open shallow 
		chimneys. The right-hand of these was taken and the climbing continued 
		directly up for about 20 ft. Then we climbed a further 15 ft., being forced 
		slightly out to the left to a projecting spike of rock. This spike is 
		split vertically, and one half is very loose. It might make a belay, but 
		the position is very cramped. However, by standing on this spike we were 
		able to get into a narrow, shallow chimney on the right, and worked up 
		this for about 15 ft. to a good foothold. </P>
	  <P>From here 
		a long step was made to the left round a projection which tends to throw 
		one out of balance. One doubtful hold may be found for the left hand by 
		gripping a narrow flake, but there is a good foothold for the left foot. 
		</P>
	  <P>Next we 
		climbed directly upwards. After the first few feet progress is made by 
		aid of two cracks sloping up from right to left about four feet apart. 
		With one foot in each of these we worked our way up for 8 ft. into a small 
		overhanging corner. A tricky step over to the right allowed us to get 
		a hand into a crack which slopes up slightly to the right. By the use 
		of jamb holds for fist and foot we worked up this crack for 10 ft. to 
		the top of the steep buttress. Here there is a splendid belay, the first 
		for about 105 ft. This pitch is very difficult and the length of rope 
		which has to be run out makes it no easier. </P>
	  <P>From here 
		we followed the crest of the ridge for 400 ft. to the top. The climbing 
		is loose but easy, and interesting on account of the narrowness of the 
		ridge in places. </P>
	  <P>We found 
		this a very entertaining climb, although all the real difficulty is concentrated 
		in the long steep pitch. For this pitch we had 130 ft. of rope between 
		each man, but 50 ft. is enough elsewhere. Cairns were built at all the 
		necessary places. </P>
	  <P>The climb 
		took about three hours from the foot of the rocks to the top. </P>

		<I>Trinity</I></H4>
	  <P>This traverse 
		was done on the summer meet of the C.U.M.C., in 1932. Starting from Turtagr&ouml; 
		after lunch, on August 28th, Wedderburn, Greenwood, Baird, and Wigram, 
		heavily laden with food and blankets, proceeded to the hut, arriving at 
		7.5 p.m. Wilson and Cram had gone up in the morning with the intention 
		of doing .html climb during the day, and we met them at the hut.</P>
	  <P>The hut 
		lies about two and a half hours from the hotel on the Skagast&ouml;lsband, 
		or col, at the foot of the ordinary route up the Skagast&ouml;lstind. 
		It was only built to hold four, and is not well designed, the draughts 
		seeming to enter between every stone. It has one good point, however, 
		a very good cooker, with the result that after a sumptuous dinner and 
		a sumptuous breakfast we did not start till 4.20 a.m. Unfortunately, Wedderburn 
		had a bad foot in the morning, so we left him to return, the five continuing 
		being Wigram, Baird, and Wilson on one rope, with Cram and Greenwood on 
		the other. We reached the top of the Skagast&ouml;lstind very quickly, 
		by 6.35 a.m., but could not stop owing to the length of the climb ahead. 
		We proposed to follow the main ridge of the group in an easterly direction 
		over five summits in all, and we had been told that we might expect ice 
		on the last, the Gjertvastind. </P>
	  <P>The day 
		was perfect for such an expedition, brilliantly fine, with a clear atmosphere, 
		and, to begin with, thick mist in the valleys. The views were consequently 
		superb, the main mass of the Jotunheim mountains lying to the east, while 
		to the north the Jostedalsbre, the largest snowfield in Europe, stretched 
		as far as the eye could see. The panorama must have stretched very nearly 
		into the Arctic Circle. </P>
	  <P>We pushed 
		on at once down to Mohns Skar and up to Vesle Skagast&ouml;lstind, which 
		we reached at 7.20 a.m., the climbing being not difficult, but always 
		interesting and sensational. The ridge was extremely steep on both sides 
		as may be witnessed by the fact that a stone set loose by one of the party 
		only bounced once before striking the glacier over a thousand feet below. 
		After a short halt we continued to the next summit, Centraltind, for breakfast, 
		reaching it at 8.30 a.m. The view of Store Skagast&ouml;lstind from here 
		is very fine, a mass of rock almost vertical on all sides, rising tooth-like 
		from the glacier below. </P>
	  <P>We were 
		off again at 9.5 a.m., the next section, down from the summit, being very 
		steep and harder than the previous climbing. This was followed by level 
		ridge-walking, the ridge in part consisting of flat slabs about 5 yds. 
		broad and vertical on either side. The next summit, the first peak of 
		Styggedalstind, was reached at 10.45 a.m., and here we could not resist 
		the temptation to stop and admire the view. We were not moving again until 
		11.10 a.m., and we passed over the second summit at 11.30 a.m., the Gjertvasskar 
		being reached at 12.5 p.m. Not knowing exactly what was lying ahead, we 
		wisely decided to have lunch. Fortunately we had plenty of bread and bilberry 
		jam; the latter, being of the consistency of soup, had to be drunk, and 
		the "hard-boiled" eggs wrapped up in one of Cram's pullovers had become 
		scrambled on the way. </P>
	  <P>The rock 
		ridge up the Gjertvastind was vertical, and the face to the south was, 
		if anything, steeper. Slingsby, on the first ascent of this peak, dropped 
		a stone down this face; it touched nothing for 9½ seconds, landing on 
		the glacier well clear of the base of the mountain. It was necessary, 
		therefore, to traverse out to the north-west face across the head of the 
		Gjertvasbre, cross the bergschrund, and ascend the ice slope above it, 
		which appeared to be at an angle of from 45 to 50 degrees. The summit, 
		we estimated, was 500 ft. above us. At 12.35 p.m. we were moving, but 
		we did not stand on top till 5.30 p.m. First of all the bergschrund gave 
		trouble. It was fairly well filled with snow, but the upper lip tended 
		to overhang, and when Wilson started to tackle it ominous cracks were 
		heard, so we beat a hasty retreat. A little further along, a rocky island 
		on the face extended down to the bergschrund, and we were able to make 
		a way up in the trough between it and the ice, until the angle of the 
		rocks eased off and we were able to make a way up them. As this step had 
		been rather awkward we brought the rucksacks up on the rope. They had 
		to be brought round a corner of rock, and when they arrived at the top 
		the rope was found to be frayed and almost worn through. </P>
	  <P>The top 
		of the rocky island was reached in two 120-ft. run-outs from the bergschrund, 
		the latter being approximately the same height as the col. From here to 
		the top stretched a &quot;pitiless ice slope.&quot; How pitiless it was 
		we did not realize until we found it required thirty to fifty strokes 
		to cut each step, the leader having an eye for pleasant security in such 
		places and not considering the rubbered rock-climber’s size in footholds 
		as being anything like suitable in such a position. </P>
	  <P>We had in 
		all brought three 120-ft. lengths of rope or line between the two parties, 
		and so to spare as many people as possible the discomfort of a perpetual 
		bombardment of ice-chips, we used it all, each man roping at the end of 
		120 ft. with two 60-ft. intervals at the end. In this way, when the leader 
		reached some rocks at the top, the last man was just starting. We had 
		in all cut 360 ft. of steps, or about 300 ft. vertically, and had taken 
		three-and-a-half hours. It was now a matter of three minutes of level 
		ridge to the top, fortunately not corniced, but it was so late that we 
		were unable to remain, and so, turning round; descended to the first stream 
		of melted snow, Here we finished our food and had a much-needed rest, 
		but were soon moving again, realizing that at least half of our<I> </I>9 
		kilometres walk back along a path would be in the dark. The lower slopes 
		were broken, and we did not reach the foot of the mountain till 8.30 p.m., 
		when it was dusk. </P>
	  <P>The less 
		said about the remaining four hours the better. Sufficient be it that 
		soon after 9.30 p.m. we lost the path for a considerable distance and 
		had very rough going, for which our three lamps were scarcely sufficient. 
		When we did eventually find it again it was hard to follow, and the leader, 
		repeatedly falling asleep as he walked, would go off at a tangent into 
		the vegetatian at the side. An Aurora Borealis cheered us for a time, 
		and when eventually the hotel was reached at 12.40 a.m., we scrounged 
		a hasty meal from the kitchen and dropped into bed. The next day was spent 
		in making up arrears of food and sleep, though Cram, not to be beaten 
		by anything, complained bitterly at wasting a whole day in so short a 
		holiday. </P>

		J. A. Leslie. </P>
	  <P>The Mitre 
		Ridge is a magnificent 600-ft. buttress of Beinn a’Bhuird, in the Cairngorms, 
		running down into Coire Garbh. It has with- stood the attempts of several 
		parties to climb it. The rock is the coarse granite of the Cairngorms, 
		uncomfortable to climb upon, the weathered edges being rounded, crumbling, 
		and sore to the touch. </P>
	  <P>On the evening 
		of July 3rd, 1933, immediately after the Skye meet, the above party launched 
		their attack, which had been entirely planned at the President’s informal 
		meetings in Cambridge. After a 10-mile walk from Inchrory in a radiant 
		twilight, a bivouac was made on the mossy floor of the lower Coire Garbh 
		at about 2,500 ft., some 500 ft. below the foot of the Mitre. </P>
	  <P>The next 
		day being perfect, the ridge was attacked by two parties. Wedderburn, 
		Baird, and Leslie attempted a route which kept as near to the ar&ecirc;te 
		as possible for its entire length. Cumming and Crofton made a route up 
		the west face. </P>
	  <P>The &quot;direct&quot; 
		route started a few yards to the west of the lowest rocks and followed 
		a groove or recess, prominent from below, which slanted to the right. 
		The first pitch was the most difficult of the whole climb and required 
		a lead out of 110 ft. Thereafter the climbing was easy until the foot 
		of the first tower, which over- hung slightly, and up which two cracks 
		ran. Both these resisted thc stoutest efforts of the leader and an escape, 
		by no means easy, was made to the left. The ar&ecirc;te was regained at 
		the top of this tower. </P>
	  <P>Thereafter 
		the route led straight up the ar&ecirc;te, and was not difficult, although 
		a sensational variation was tried on the second tower with sensational 
		results. </P>
	  <P>Cumming 
		and Crofton’s route was shorter, but gave more consistently difficult 
		climbing. Starting near the spot marked X in the photograph the climb 
		led up the angle between the main ridge and its subsidiary buttress. The 
		second pitch led up the right- hand of two possible chimneys, and here 
		an overhanging tongue gave some sport. Beyond that the climbing was mainly 
		difficult on account of the perched blocks on ledges and the long lead-outs 
		required. A dislodged boulder the size of a sheep caused a tense second 
		or two and much noise in the echoing coire. After joining the ar&ecirc;te 
		at the gap between the first and second towers, the route was the same 
		as the other. </P>
	  <P>Cumming 
		and Crofton, leading through, took two hours, the other party three, to 
		complete the ascent.</P>
	  <H2>THE NORTH-WEST 
		HIGHLANDS </H2>
	  <H4>P. D. BAIRD,<I> 
		Corpus Christi</I> </H4>
	  <P>THERE were 
		three of us, all C,U.M.C. members: E. J. A. Leslie, J. W. Crofton, and 
		myself, who decided to escape from examination results and the effects 
		these have on family relationships. </P>
	  <P>It was also 
		economically sound to forgo the glorious pageantry of degree-taking in 
		person, and to occupy the time till the Skye meet this trip to the North-West 
		Highlands was planned. The main object of this note is to encourage further 
		research in this district, which is not so very inaccessible to the club 
		if you follow these directions carefully. </P>
	  <P>First you 
		have to get there, and internal combustion is the only suitable method. 
		Mountaineers’ cars are sold at most garages; mention the late President’s 
		name and you will be dealt with at once. A pile of spare tyres and water 
		vessels is recommended, and remember – put your sanest member at the wheel 
		The road by Lochinver brings out suicidal tendencies in most people; it 
		is narrow, winding, always blind, and the 12 m.p.h. limit is dangerously 
		fast. </P>
	  <P>Then you 
		must be prepared to camp. Pubs are rare, and those that exist cater for 
		fishermen, who are sticklers for comfort and cuisine when the wet and 
		midgy days are over. Moreover they pay for it, while you probably cannot. 
		Besides, at the time of year we are contemplating, what could be finer 
		than the genial comradeship of seasoned climbers, the roaring primus at 
		the tent door, the scented airs that... Knowing these joys we pulled strings, 
		and were kindly entertained for part of our time in a stalker’s cottage 
		in a large forest, confining our camping to the earlier half. </P>
	  <P>Then the 
		rock. In the Assynt and Coigach districts the mountains are either lumps 
		of Torridon sandstone, forgotten in the process of geological spring-cleaning, 
		or thrust structures capped with quartzite. The latter forms the world’s 
		worst scree, and gives no respectable rock faces, so we kept to the sandstone. 
		This is generally much harder to climb than it looks. The mountains are 
		built up of great horizontal layers of rock with numerous grassy terraces 
		and nooks, and, occasionally, some unstable pinnacles resembling piles 
		of pancakes. Of course, there are no belays, as most of the holds are 
		well rounded, so we carried a poker, and anchored the party to the turf 
		ledges by means of this. </P>
	  <P>We had three 
		good climbs on the Torridonian; which are described in detail in S.M.C.J. 
		No. 116. First came the Sgurr an Fhidhleir ridge, 600 ft. high, which 
		steepens to 70 degrees. This gave a grand sensational climb of moderate 
		difficulty; then we had a short climb, three pitches, on Stac Polly of 
		much the same standard; last a longer climb, also of three pitches, on 
		S&agrave;il Liath (An Teallach). This was a delightfully definite ar&ecirc;te 
		and much sounder rock for climbing (very difficult). </P>
	  <P>In the region 
		near Loch Maree the Lewisian gneiss rises to over 3,000 ft., and gives 
		a very different type of climbing. It is very rough and hard, and weathers 
		in a curious way, so that neatly shaped boot- and finger-holds are conveniently 
		prepared in the steepest faces. </P>
	  <P>Going south 
		from our cottage base we bivouacked for a night among these hills, and 
		climbed both days. The Brst was on Sgurr na Laocainn, a four-pitch climb 
		on a crag where many much longer climbs could be found. The lowest of 
		these pitches was probably severe, the remainder moderately difficult, 
		including a long lead- out in a splendid chimney. </P>
	  <P>Next day 
		we went up A’Mhaighdean, and found a climb of about 400 ft. to the south-west 
		of its summit. This was the most enjoyable of all, easy difficult standard 
		except for the first pitch – a trickster, and with very varied problems. 
		</P>
	  <P>We were 
		fortunately much alike in degree of skill, so took turns to lead on different 
		days. If the leader failed or looked unsatisfactory. a fresh climber was 
		thrown into the breach – Bavarianism almost. Crofton was the &quot;crack&quot; 
		man, or was employed for muscular little overhangs; Leslie walked delicately 
		on steep slabs; I was called into play whenever extra reach was thought 
		to be required. </P>
	  <P>The point 
		is that we only nibbled at the possibilities of the district. There is 
		heaps more to be done, and exploring brand-new climbs has a tremendous 
		fascination. Moreover, this is a unique and beautiful country. Where else 
		can you hope to see an eagle almost every day on the hills (good omen 
		this), or a blue hare tamely loping up the slopes in front of you (bad 
		this – means it probably won’t go without a death). At Eastertime or in 
		summer it should be equally attractive. </P>
	  <P>So gird 
		on your ropes and go. </P>
	  <H2>BEN NEVIS 
		</H2>
	  <H4>M. S. CUMMING,<I> 
		Caius</I> </H4>
	  <P>Being unable, 
		for various reasons, to attend the official Easter meet of the club, six 
		of us spent three or four days at the S.M.C. hut on Ben Nevis: P. D. Baird, 
		E. J. A. Leslie, R. C. Hutt, D. A. Howarth, F. W. L. Blaikie, and M. S. 
		Cumming. </P>
	  <P>With the 
		exception of one day the weather was awful; incessant rain and mist not 
		only damped our ardour but ruined the condition of the ice and snow in 
		the gullies, and left a horrible mixture of slush and wet ice on the rocks. 
		</P>
	  <P>We climbed 
		in two parties; each party did the Tower Ridge and the North-East Buttress, 
		while one party did the Staircase Route on Carn Dearg. Under the conditions 
		the Recess Route was amusing, and we duly appreciated the airiness of 
		the Tower Gap. </P>
	  <P>On the one 
		day that it did not rain we did a hitherto unrecorded route to the first 
		platform of the North-East Buttress. It started to the left of Raeburn’s 
		Route, up the ar&ecirc;te, and traversing upwards and to the right crossed 
		his route just above the start; the traverse was continued until a groove 
		was reached which leads straight up, about 50 to 100 yds. to the right 
		of the ar&ecirc;te, until it abuts on the head of the ar&ecirc;te just 
		below the first platform; this gave quite an amusing climb; it is well 
		defined, and the groove, if taken direct, offers one or two pitches which 
		require thought. If it had nothing else to commend it, it would be worth 
		climbing as it offers magnificent views, even if their appreciation may 
		sometimes be disturbed by the lack of good stances and belays. </P>
	  <P>Experience 
		taught us two things on this party – that few people in Fort William can 
		give adequate instructions of the route to the hut, and that to find the 
		Carn Dearg ar&ecirc;te from the top of Ben Nevis is far from easy in mist 
		or darkness. Two members of the party reached Fort William in the evening 
		after travelling from London. By following the directions they received 
		in Fort William as to the route to the hut, they found themselves somewhat 
		exhausted on a large snowfield. It was then almost midnight, so dumping 
		their rucksacks containing extra provisions they descended. After sleeping 
		the night in a barn and breakfasting off raw sausages, they re- ascended 
		and found their sacks just below the top of Ben Nevis. </P>
	  <P>The other 
		point was brought home to us even more forcibly. After our first climb 
		we found that the mist on top of Ben Nevis was too thick to allow us to 
		distinguish between the gullies. We decided, therefore, to take the easy 
		way down by the Carn Dearg ar6te; we took a compass bearing and set off; 
		over an hour later we were taking a last despairing bearing from the summit 
		indicator, having determined to descend at all costs and risk missing 
		the ar&ecirc;te, in which case we would land in Glen Nevis, a long way 
		from the hut. We were lucky and reached the hut just after dark. The other 
		rope had left after us, so we knew they would be late. They did not turn 
		up at all, and though we guessed they had gone down to Glen Nevis we were 
		far from happy, and at about 11 o’clock went out to indulge in the old 
		Scottish mountaineering pastime of blowing whistles. </P>
	  <P>I have blown 
		whistles on many occasions, pleasant and unpleasant, but may I never have 
		to blow one again at 11 o’clock on a wet night at the North-East Buttress 
		on Ben Nevis. You could almost hear the spirits of the hill laughing at 
		your feeble efforts as you stumbled and fell over the rough ground below. 
		Needless to say, the defaulters had reached the top rather late, missed 
		the way to the ar&ecirc;te, and arrived in Glen Nevis at dusk. Wisely 
		enough, they did not attempt to recross the ar&ecirc;te, but walked the 
		tedious miles to Fort William. </P>
	  <P>The story 
		cannot end without commending the valiant effort of the leader of the 
		party, who left Fort William at midnight and came up to the hut to allay 
		our fears. </P>

	  <P>No guide-books 
		have ever revealed records of climbs in Ireland; but to the belief that 
		climbs there must be the writer has long held, Tales of &quot;quite large 
		precipices, though the rock looks pretty bad&quot; in the &quot;Prisons&quot; 
		(as the dark, raven-haunted<I> cwms</I> are called) of &quot;Lug,&quot; 
		brought back by rambling friends, induced J. W. Crofton (C.U.M.C.), H. 
		D. O’Brien, and myself to try our fortune there. So with 200 ft. of rope 
		the three of us set out in an elderly car in April 1933, for Rathdrum, 
		some 40 miles from Dublin. Thence we walked the 10 miles to Aghavanna, 
		to the south of the mountain, where we spent the night in a cheerless 
		and insect-ridden hotel. Next day we went north up the valley of the Ow 
		River, towards something which we fondly imagined was a cliff Alas, we 
		were disappointed. It was merely a steep, boulder-strown slope. Plenty 
		of boulder problems (and mossy ones they were) amused us, but no continuous 
		climb. However we were not entirely done, for on the right, on a spur 
		of Lugnaquilla called Percy’s Table, was a little cliff about 100 ft. 
		high and 250 ft. long, of excellent slabby rock. We named it Percy’s Slabs, 
		and proceeded to climb it. It yielded four climbs of moderate difficulty. 
		No belays were found, and we climbed separately; gardening (we did a little 
		with a boy scout’s axe – an excellent implement if provided with a sling) 
		might reveal some. </P>
	  <P>The climbs 
		made were: Three on the three slabs into which the cliff is divided by 
		small mossy gullies (one fell to each of the party) and one on a rib which 
		runs up the right-hand gully. This, the most difficult climb, was first 
		done by Crofton; an alternative start on a triangular slab to the left 
		was made by the writer. </P>
	  <P>We finished 
		the ascent of the mountain – a fine one, and the highest in Leinster (our 
		only regret was having brought the superfluous ropes). After a pleasant 
		day we returned gladly to the inevitable rashers and eggs and tea. On 
		the morrow we walked back via Glenmalure to Rathdrum. As a mountaineering 
		venture, the excursion was perhaps a failure, but the hills are well worth 
		a visit, and our slabs are a pleasant diversion. </P>

		number of entertaining boulders, which may amuse anyone staying in Dublin, 
		who wants to polish up the nails in his climbing boots. Two rather holdless 
		40-ft. slabs certainly gave Crofton, O’Brien, and myself plenty of exercise 
		and, till we roped, some qualms, unfit as we were when we visited them 
		last Easter Vac. </P>

	  <P>IN visiting 
		Connemara for the first time last August I was accompanied by two non-climbers, 
		and consequently we have more reconnaissance than climbs to our credit. 
		Our single ascent was of a subsidiary rib of the main buttress on the 
		north face of Bercow. The climb started up two prominent white slabs and 
		continued as far as possible up the ar&ecirc;te, finishing by two short 
		but interesting chimneys. Scrambling was necessary between certain of 
		the pitches, and some of the more interesting parts could have been turned, 
		but the climb was on the whole enjoyable. The rock is quartz, and difficult 
		for boots at the start, though the weathering makes it easier higher up. 
		The standard was about that of a Welsh &quot;difficult,&quot; though the 
		second of the initial slabs, if climbed on the face, might be equivalent 
		to a Skye &quot;severe.&quot; The main buttress, which we regarded ourselves 
		as too inexperienced to attempt, might well repay further investigation.

	  <H2>CAMBRIDGE 
		</H2>
	  <H3>THE CHERRYHINTON 
		CHALK PITS</H3>
	  <H4>E. J. C. 
		KENDALL,<I> Downing</I> </H4>
	  <P>It is often 
		assumed that Cambridge is no place for the active climber; he will find, 
		indeed, many fellow enthusiasts, but to indulge in his sport he must travel 
		some hundred miles for the sight of a piece of rock, and climbing on buildings 
		has its own kind of perils. Yet within two miles of Cambridge are chalk 
		pits which give a specialized sort of climbing and a very pleasant Sunday 
		afternoon’s sport as well. It is climbing in miniature, but within their 
		modest height the climbs contain a surprising variety of problems, and 
		they give on a small scale practice in many departments of mountaineering. 
		It is not mere freak climbing, bouldering on peculiar rock; indeed, it 
		can teach a good deal in the way of balance technique. Rush and grab methods 
		simply will not work on a rock of extremely variable quality; for even 
		at its best each hold needs testing, and the climber will do well to maintain 
		as many points of attachment as possible. </P>
	  <P>The pits 
		in which most climbing has been done lie along the Cherryhinton Road; 
		on reaching the village itself from Cambridge the road up the hill on 
		the right is taken, which goes past the reservoir. Before this is reached 
		a concrete track leads on the left hand into a deep quarry, and on Saturday 
		afternoons and Sundays this will be found deserted, and placed, so rumour 
		says, at the disposal of all rock climbers. </P>
	  <P>The pit 
		widens at the end of the track into a rectangular arena, and on three 
		sides of this the chalk rises steeply in walls about go ft. high. Since 
		the pit is still being worked, the configuration of the climb changes 
		rapidly; but it may be stated briefly that the climbing lies on the walls 
		ahead and to the right as one enters. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		buttress on the right is known as the Presidential Buttress; the climbs 
		on this have been partly destroyed, unfortunately. Several other climbs 
		lie on the lower wall, which is separated in this part of the pit by a 
		sloping glacis from the upper wall, which itself contains two easy ways 
		off and a rickety staircase climb. </P>
	  <P>Further 
		round a high vertical wall provides the would-be Alpinist with good practice 
		in abseiling, with the added attraction of heavy stonefall as he descends. 
		This is characteristic of all parts of the pit, and before commencing 
		operations above, the presence of fellow climbers below should be guarded 
		against. </P>
	  <P>The side 
		of the pit ahead as one enters consists of a nearly vertical wall 20 ft. 
		high, and a steep, loose slope above, divided by the quarrying operations 
		into definite couloirs, each ending in a narrow funnel. A cart is sometimes 
		placed below, and forms an easy method of ascent and a happy landing in 
		case of descent. The upper slope will be found useful to practice step 
		kicking upon, and under favourable conditions good glissades have been 
		made down these couloirs. A prominent slab in this part of the pit has 
		several systems of steps cut in its surface; the angle is considerable 
		and steepens at the highest part, where it is surmounted by the loose 
		slope. The direct finish of the climb thus gives a pretty problem. </P>
	  <P>A small 
		pit on the other side of the road also merits attention. Coming up the 
		hill from Cherryhinton, the entrance to the large pit is passed on the 
		left, and below the second gate on the right the small pit will be found; 
		access to it is given by a path on its right edge. Standing on the floor 
		of the pit we see a face about go ft. high; four interesting routes lie 
		on the left side; unfortunately the chalk is rotten to the right, where 
		the diff bulges out into a fine nose. The principal climb is known as 
		Suspension Slab, so-called after the predicament of an early explorer 
		on attempting to gain the small slab near the top of the face. The route 
		starts from a cairn, with suitably inscribed splinth, and goes straight 
		up over steep sound chalk for 12 ft; a rising traverse is now made to 
		the right in the direction of the slab itself. A shallow scoop is gained 
		directly above the slab and for the last 10 ft. the angle, which lower 
		down approaches the vertical, eases off to compensate for the growing 
		rottenness of the rock. </P>
	  <P>A direct 
		route gains the slab, starting from a point directly below it, and short 
		variations are possible to the left of the original route. </P>
	  <P>All these 
		climbs are on natural holds, and the routes will be recognized by the 
		state of polish existing on them. Another route starts from a shallow 
		groove to the right of the direct route and immediately to the left of 
		a diminutive ar&ecirc;te bounding the nose; this entailed considerable 
		engineering operations of a most exhausting nature in its lower stretches. 
		The groove is surmounted in a chimney- like manner, and the arkte gained 
		and followed to a diminutive niche. This, however, gives no shelter, so 
		the climber is forced to traverse to the left to the level of the slab, 
		and to finish up the usual way. This is the hardest climb in the pits, 
		but the holds should be treated with circumspection, as many are cut in 
		large, semi-detached blocks. </P>
	  <P>Most of 
		the climbs in this pit have been led, but the cautious climber will require 
		a rope from above. A convenient gatepost provides an ample belay; it is 
		best to use this, as a pleasant Sunday afternoon conversation on top of 
		the pit may be interrupted with a suddenness directly attributable to 
		the unreliability of chalk. </P>
	  <P>A sunken 
		kiln near the face holds four routes, and a girdle traverse on its modest 
		surface; they will be found pleasantly restful after exertions on the 
		cliff. The other parts of the pit are disappointing; in spite of its large 
		size, few routes are to be made. </P>
	  <P>In most 
		of the climbs it will be found possible to utilize the natural holds, 
		but in some cases it is necessary to cut them. A light hammer with a long 
		spike, held to the wrist with a loop, will be found most practicable, 
		but a nice sense of discrimination in its use is needed, as the character 
		of the chalk makes it possible to alter the complexion of a climb materially 
		with a little exertion. A domestic poker with a sharp end has been used 
		as a piton, but the chalk was found deficient in holding power and the 
		poker in rigidity. </P>
	  <P>Finally, 
		it may be said that to the enthusiastic maker of new routes, the chalk 
		pits offer exceptional attractions, as new routes are constantly made 
		from the ruins of the old. </P>
	  <H2>THE INTERNATIONAL 
		MOUNTAINEERING CONGRESS </H2>
	  <H4>D. A. HOWARTH,<I> 
		Trinity</I> </H4>
	  <P>As the two 
		C.U.M.C. representatives at the International Mountaineering Congress 
		at Cortina, R. D. Adgey-Edgar and I were somewhat hampered by having no 
		foreign tongue between us except public-school French. The business of 
		the congress was sup- posed to be done in English, French, German, and 
		Italian; but as the only other Englishman there was Colonel Strutt, who 
		speaks a large number of languages, everyone seemed to assume that English 
		was unnecessary. I dare say someone asked us in Italian if we spoke Italian, 
		which would account for everything, as our only word in that language 
		was &quot;si.&quot; Anyhow the result was that we only made one public 
		remark during the whole show. </P>
	  <P>However, 
		this was probably an advantage in some ways. Speaking for myself, I think 
		that my enforced dumbness and what I hoped was a knowing expression were 
		more impressive than anything I might have had to say about &quot;alpinism.&quot; 
		The fact that we were there was what mattered. The Alpine Club was the 
		only other British club which was represented, and there were delegates 
		from about twenty countries; so I hope that in those twenty countries 
		at least anyone giving a list of British mountaineering clubs would say 
		&quot;the Alpine Club and the C.U.M.C.&quot; </P>
	  <P>When I arrived 
		in Cortina I found the whole town plastered with posters saying: &quot;Vive 
		il Club Alpino Italiano,&quot; &quot;Per il Presi- dent del C.A.I., Eja! 
		Eja! Eja! Alala!&quot; and other curious but pleasantly enthusiastic remarks; 
		and the proceedings began with a procession of all the climbers in the 
		neighbourhood, complete with boots and ropes, and led by General Manaresi, 
		the president of the C.A.I. However, the main business of the congress 
		was to discuss various aspects of mountaineering and to see what could 
		be done about them. These discussions were divided up into four parts: 
		alpinism, or climbing technique, science, art, and &quot;turismo.&quot; 
		There was a long argument as to how &quot;turismo&quot; could be translated 
		into other languages, and at the end of it all I was still not certain 
		what it meant. Anyhow, it seemed to have nothing to do with tourists. 
		I think one might define it as the technique of getting to the bottom 
		of one’s climb. The most important questions which arose under this heading 
		concerned the provision and management of huts. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Science 
		and the mountains&quot; gave rise to more talk than anything else; and 
		it certainly seems to me that this is the subject in which international 
		co-operation of this kind might be most useful. Indeed, technique and 
		art, and, if my definition of it is right, &quot;turismo&quot; as well, 
		are largely matters of personal taste; and though it is interesting to 
		hear of other people’s ideas in these directions, discussion of them cannot 
		be anything more than criticism. But I think the congress did useful work 
		on at least two scientific subjects. A permanent commission was elected 
		to extend the publication of weather reports in climbing districts, and 
		to make arrangements for combining the experience of mountaineers and 
		weather experts in sending out warnings of bad weather. Also a summary 
		is going to be made of all that is known about snow conditions, and this 
		will be published somehow in winter sports centres. </P>
	  <P>If this 
		was all the congress had done I think it would have been worth while; 
		but I have no doubt at all that it did a lot of other good work which 
		I didn’t understand. </P>
	  <P>One question 
		which arose was whether in future individual clubs should be allowed to 
		send representatives, or whether national representatives should be elected 
		by the clubs of each country. The division was about even on this, so 
		they decided to take a list of which clubs wanted which. We did not see 
		why future members of the C.U.M.C. should be denied the amusement we had 
		got out of the congress, so we voted – we hope – against national representatives. 
		I mention all this because it gave rise to our only comment on the proceedings, 
		which I referred to above, and in fact it was the only time I have ever 
		made a public speech in any foreign language whatever. When they started 
		reading out a list of the clubs we were both overcome with panic; however, 
		when it came to our turn I manfully gasped &quot;Afili&eacute;,&quot; 
		and immediately collapsed, breathing heavily. It seemed to convey something 
		to everybody. I hope it was what we meant. </P>
	  <P>The Italians 
		we met – mostly members of the C.A.I.– were most hospitable people. We 
		have asked General Manaresi to become an honorary member of the C.U.M.C. 
		It was the least return we could make for a great deal of kindness. </P>
	  <P>We only 
		had time for two climbs while we were there, both of which were rather 
		inglorious. We started up Monte Cristallo, but were beaten by a very thick 
		cloud about 1,000 ft. below the top; and later on I went up Tofane di 
		Roces alone, which is quite tall, but probably the easiest of all the 
		Dolomites. So the less said about that the better. </P>
	  <P>Next year 
		the congress is going to be held at Pontresina, and the year after that 
		in Barcelona. To establish the international fame of the C.U.M.C. I think 
		we should send a team of about six expert linguists to both these places. 
		And I recommend it to anyone, linguist or not, as a very amusing holiday.
