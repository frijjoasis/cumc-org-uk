<DIV align="center"><H1>SOCIAL CLIMBING</H1>
<H2>Celia Robertson</H2>
</DIV>


<P>Bullshit and beer stream endlessly <BR>
In all the crowded bars <BR>
Up and down the country, <BR>
Beneath the trembling stars. <BR>
From Sligachen to Keswick, <BR>
Torridon to Land’s End, <BR>
How his helmet saved his life, <BR>
How he lost a friend. <BR>
The merits of a chalk-bag, <BR>
Two-tone tights are best, <BR>
Clean it with a tooth brush first- <BR>
I never wear a vest…………… </P>

<P>Have you done Deaf Banana <BR>
Up by Scar-Crag-Streaky-Falls? <BR>
Tried it late last Autumn <BR>
And nearly lost my balls! <BR>
-Yeah; we did that thing last April, <BR>
The run-outs are superb! <BR>
Really spaced me out, though- <BR>
Nearly lost my nerve. </P>

<P>And then there’s Screaming Maisonette- <BR>
That overhang’s the worst- <BR>
Pumped me out in just five minutes, <BR>
And all my blisters burst. <BR>
My second got severe pneumonia, <BR>
From standing there all night, <BR>
While I, shit-scared but determined, <BR>
Broke my jaw and got frostbite. </P>

<P>What are those Winter routes like? <BR>
-Psycho’s Gully, Moron’s Wall. <BR>
-O.K, if you’ve got screws and stuff- <BR>
The chimney’s pretty small. <BR>
Did P.G. in an hour or so <BR>
But the whole thing’s pretty chossy- <BR>
You get absolutely fucking soaked <BR>
Because the rock’s all wet and mossy. </P>

<P>Tender Fury and Dead Monkey <BR>
Are different altogether– <BR>
No problem with protection, <BR>
Though you have to watch the weather. <BR>
With a massive drop on one side, <BR>
You edge round the jutting flake, <BR>
Following the ice-fall <BR>
Until it makes a break. <BR>
Sling a runner round the holly bush <BR>
And stretch to find the hold, <BR>
It’s down a little, narrow crack- <BR>
Then the crux is really bold. <BR>
Lever your whole body up <BR>
And kick hard with your points, <BR>
Jam your head in sideways, <BR>
And thrust at every joint. <BR>
Wriggle on your back, then <BR>
Along the bevelled terrace <BR>
To where the track turns to descend, <BR>
Down by Wrencher’s Crevice. </P>

<P>Bullshit and beer stream endlessly <BR>
In all the crowded bars <BR>
Up and down the country, <BR>
Beneath the trembling stars. </P>

<P>A thousand near-deaths are recounted, <BR>
A million thrutchy moves, <BR>
Countless desparate lunges <BR>
To mega-greasy grooves. <BR>
The finger-holds which gave way, <BR>
Loose crampons and despair... <BR>
High heroics on the rock-face, <BR>
High heroics from a chair. </P>
