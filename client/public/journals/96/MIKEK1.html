<H2>Mike Kendon</H2>
</DIV>

<I>
(Mike the cartoon man has supplied scribblings to the CUMC for four years; journals and T-shirts around Cambridge bear his handy work.  Mike is a mountain man, able to keep his cool when all those around him are loosing their head.  Maybe he never realises the trouble he&#39;s in?)
</I>

<DIV align="center"><P>
There&#39;s nowhere more I&#39;d rather be<BR>
Than going up North with the CUMC.<BR>
Out on the crag, he who lingers<BR>
Takes all the skin off his knuckles and fingers.<BR>
Out on the crag, tasting the fear<BR>
Then down in the pub and drinking beer.
<P>
Exams and Tripos, what&#39;s that to me?<BR>
It&#39;s a load of old bollocks, can&#39;t you see,<BR>
Compared to the top of a big E3<BR>
Pulling over the crux - a hard 5c?   (dream on etc...)<BR>
(Although to be honest I have to say<BR>
I&#39;d rather prefer an easy 5a.)
<P>
If you are a climber, then how can you spend<BR>
All your time in Cambridge at the weekend?<BR>
Get out to the mountains and onto the crag,<BR>
And a load of new routes put into the bag.<BR>
Don&#39;t worry at all if the workload mounts - <BR>
It&#39;s the climbing and not the work that counts.
<P>
So to all those who like the rock, I say,<BR>
&quot;Go on, bugger off and get out there today!&quot;
</DIV>
