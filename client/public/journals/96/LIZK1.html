<H2>Liz Kennett</H2>
</DIV>

<I>(Liz is one of the new members to the club.  On the novice meets she complained bitterly that everything was too easy!  She soon picked up a taste for leading, and finally met her match on the Dream of White Horses, when a kind passer-by had to lower her a rope, after she got lost on the blank face, with her last runner thirty feet beneath her.)
</I>

<DIV align="center"><P>
For many climbing is a bug<BR>
An obsessive passion<BR>
Even a death wish<BR>
I ask, what makes us climb on?
<P>
Some are attracted by the garish gear<BR>
The clinking of the crabs<BR>
Fluorescent clinging lycras<BR>
Which flash against the crags.
<P>
For some it is a competitive sport<BR>
Graded technical play<BR>
Boasting to friends in the pub<BR>
Of routes climbed that day.
<P>
Maybe it is the satisfaction<BR>
Of taking on the lead<BR>
A challenge to the individual<BR>
To overcome fear and succeed.
<P>
For some it is the sense of freedom<BR>
A chance to unwind<BR>
An escape from the madding crowd<BR>
Leaving stress of work behind.
<P>
For many it is being in the mountains<BR>
All their awe and majesty<BR>
A desolate expanse<BR>
A wilderness of tranquillity.
<P>
For some the bleakness of a sea crag<BR>
The wind&#39;s fearsome power<BR>
Incessant pounding waves<BR>
How insignificant we are.
<P>
For others pausing at the belay<BR>
A rare moment of still<BR>
A chance to reflect on past times<BR>
And shared dreams, until ...<BR>
The next time.</DIV>
