<P>Writing this bit signals the beginning of the end of my job as journal editor.  All articles and art work have been processed, and only the layout of  Cambridge Mountaineering 1996 is yet to be finalised.   I hope that you enjoy flicking though these pages as much as I have enjoyed being part of the CUMC these last twelve months.

<P>The club has enjoyed huge success this year.  Membership is close to 200, and the number of people climbing regularly to a high standard is constantly increasing.  The women in the club have progressed particularly; at least three have led E1 or harder.  This journal also indicates the diversity of activity, from first ascents in the Himalaya, through Alpine Grandes Courses and classic gritstone, to the gymnastics of bouldering competitions.  With more novices learning to lead than ever, the club can look forward to many more successful years.

<P>Last year Cambridge Mountaineering didn't materialise due to a lack of articles from members.  Therefore this journal encompasses both 1995 and 1996.  In my view this reflects the difficulty people have in writing about mountaineering.  How can you express in words something you don't really understand?  Why I climb isn't a question that I ask myself, the question I ask is when can I climb again.
