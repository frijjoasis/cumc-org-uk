<H1>The Brouillard Ridge</H1><hr>

	  
	  <P>THIS 
		great climb, up the longest and highest ridge in Western Europe, used 
		to arouse almost as much international interest among mountaineers as, 
		more recently, the ascent of Everest. In part this was due to the fact 
		that every detail upon it could be seen and discussed at leisure by the 
		congregations in Courmayeur: in part to its unique situation, on the finest 
		mountain wall, scenically, in the Alps: in part to the height, scale, 
		and actual difficulty of the glaciers and ridges that defended it; and 
		in good part, also, to the almost superstitious traditions which had grown 
		up about its inaccessibility. <BR>

		  The Brouillard Ridge 
	  </DIV>
	  <P>Mr. Oscar 
		Eckenstein first pointed out the right line of attack. For years after 
		he had himself reached the Col Emile Rey, and was prevented from further 
		high mountaineer- ing, he used to watch from Courmayeur for the season 
		when the 'flaw' should be free of ice. Mr. H. O. Jones, of Clare, Mr. 
		E. T. Compton, Dr. Karl Blodig, and others, all reached the Col, in successive 
		explorations. The Duca degli Abruzzi, after reconnaissances by his Guides, 
		first reached the Pic Luigi Amedeo by descending the ridge from Mont Blanc 
		The redoubtable brothers Gugliermina, after crossing the Col with many 
		nights out, reached. the same peak, after more nights out, directly up 
		the wall from the Mont Blanc glacier In 1911, the 'perfect ' season, Dr. 
		Blodig, Dr. Puhn, Dr. Pfann and Mr. Jones, were all waiting in Courmayeur, 
		separately, to attempt the last link in the ridge climb the ascent from 
		the Col to the Pic. It was achieved by a combination of elements, old 
		and new Mr. Jones, Dr. Blodig, Josef Knubel and myself in the course of 
		a day; and repeated during the next few days by the severa1 parties of 
		Drs. Puhn and Pfann: both these parties spending the night after in the 
		Vallot hut under the summit. Since 1911 the climb has not, to my knowledge 
		been repeated, until the ascent by Van Noorden and Wyn Harris without 
		guides last year, under far less favourable conditions. 
	  <P>I can say 
		advisedly, therefore, that theirs was a magnificent piece of mountaineering. 
		There are no outstand- ing technical difficulties except for the one short 
		passage in the "flaw." But the mere scale of the environment is daunting 
		to the nerves: the introductory route-finding calls for careful exploration 
		and sound judgment; and the climbing for unrelaxing vigilance and sureness 
		for the whole of a long day, over every variety of high-alpine incident 
		and interruption. I should consider it an ascent ideally contrived to 
		distinguish between acrobatics and sound and enduring mountaineering qualities. 
		I need not explain that the letter which follows was written to me in 
		reply to one of mine, asking the two mountaineers for the details. <BR>

	  <P>DEAR MR. 
		YOUNG, We were so pleased to receive your letter, for as yet we have had 
		no one to talk to about the Brouillard - at Chamonix we had but a short 
		hour after descent before we had to come on here, whilst to the Arolla 
		type of mind, the Brouillard is less than a mere name. 
	  <P>Your letter 
		encourages us to hope that a few details may not be boring. 
	  <P>The party 
		consisted only of Wyn Harris and myself. We had practically no moon it 
		rose just before dawn, but we were continuously in the shadow of the ridge.. 
		We left the Quintino Sella at midnight exactly, and crossed the glacier 
		by previously cut steps. The ribs of rock following were rather slow work 
		in the dark, but once on the glacier we made fair progress. We had previously 
		worked out a route through the crevasses, which was very fortunate, as 
		they would have been extremely troublesome in the dark otherwise. With 
		claws the couloir itself gave no difficulty, the schrund being easily 
		turned over to the right, and we arrived on the Col Emile Rey at 4.30 
		to see, on the far side, an amazing sea of cloud, tinged scarlet by the 
		rising sun, which just swamped the Dames Anglaises, the Aiguille Noire 
		looking a magnificent spire thrusting up through the cloud. 
	  <P>After a 
		second breakfast we left (4.45) with some misgivings about the weather, 
		and traversed (after weeks of anticipation) to the foot of the gully. 
		It was choked with great icy columns and pillars and, to our judgment, 
		was quite impossible after one pitch. Harris tried a route on the left 
		wall, but we were brought up after about zoo feet by an incoherent snow 
		cornice. I then started up an icy pitch on the right wall, Harris led 
		through me and up a difficult iced chimney to an icy platform with a big 
		iced bollard for belay. I then tried a traverse to the right but was brought 
		up after 10 feet by vertical rotten ice. 
	  <P>The last 
		alternative was the wall straight above. I believe this was strictly vertical 
		with the exception of a gang- way sloping up to the right and outwards, 
		about two feet wide, which finished about eight feet from the top of the 
		wall. Only the first step of this was icy. Harris led up the gangway, 
		but could not manage the wall above in his rucksack, for the finger strain 
		seemed considerable. So he returned and I had a shot without rucksack 
		and taking a shoulder for the first step to save time and strain. I found 
		I could hold myself in at the top of the gangway by finger holds, and 
		put one hand over the top of the wall, but there were no definite holds. 
		
	  <P>After a 
		rest I had a second shot and quite suddenly found the solution in a long 
		stride to the left to a fair foothold and then up easy rocks to finish 
		the fifty-foot pitch. 
	  <P>I hauled 
		up the baggage and Harris followed very speedily. It was here that a solitary 
		stone fell with a smack a yard from us. This was all we saw fall during 
		the day, but it made us hurry all together up the remainder of the wall 
		of the gully, Harris cutting up an ice cascade in a chimney on the way 
		- rather difficult - until, bearing left, we passed a small neve patch 
		on the right. Here we unroped and wandered delightfully straight up to 
		the Amedeo, keeping on the rocks just to the left of a long neve slope. 
		We reached the Amedeo at 9.45 and had half an hour's halt. 
	  <P>At 10.15 
		we left on a short rope (I led) and were going well when we were enveloped 
		in a very appropriate mist; but when we got higher - on to the less steep 
		and snowy ridge before Mont Blanc de Courmayeur, the weather became worse 
		and we were rather worried, not knowing the geography and thinking we 
		should be already past Mont Blanc de Courmayeur when we were obviously 
		not so. However, we put on claws again, Harris took the lead and we trudged 
		on by compass until at 4.0 we decided that a number of bottles and sardine 
		tins represented the summit [of Mont Blanc]. It took us 1 1/4 hours from 
		the summit to the Vallot hut for we had to take great care over the compass 
		- except in occasional 'thinnings' we could not see twenty yards beyond 
		our noses - and snow and wind made map and compass work quite trying. 
		We reached the hut at 5.3o and decided to stop the night. Actually, we 
		could have got to the Grands Mulets in .html two hours, for just below 
		the hut the usual groove-like track started down the soft snow. It was 
		a glorious day's work; it was a pity we had to take heavy sacks it spoiled 
		our times rather but we had no more time left to return to Courmayeur 
		and had to take everything with us. 
	  <P>The weather 
		was horrible all the time - never more than three days fine consecutively. 
		Consequently, in our three weeks at Chamonix we got very little done. 
		Col des Cristaux, Col du Geant, Aiguille du Geant, Aig. Noire de Peuteret 
		and attempts on the Tour Noir and the Moine ridge of the Verte. The latter 
		was grand, but we were turned by time only 400 feet from the summit and 
		got off the glacier at 9.0 P.M. 
	  <P>Arolla has 
		been a pleasant interlude, but to-morrow we leave for the Bricolla to 
		traverse Dent Blanche - we have had two days fine up to to-day and with 
		to-morrow the West ridge might be in condition. 
	  <P>Please excuse 
		this very full and lengthy description when one starts to describe such 
		a climb shortly it runs into an amazing length! </P>
