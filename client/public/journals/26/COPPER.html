		<H1>Mount Coppercrown </H1><HR>

	  <P>THE following 
		account of the first ascent of one of the peaks of the Purcell Range, 
		in the Canadian Rockies, has been taken from a letter from N..M. P. Reilly, 
		a former President of the (Cambridge) club. </P>
	  <P>It should 
		perhaps be explained that the Purcell Range lies just to the west of the 
		main range of the Rockies near the United States border, and south of 
		the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway through Banff: from here 
		the party of four drove 109 miles to Wilmer, and 24 miles beyond up a 
		side valley, &quot;Toby Creek,&quot; to the end of the road, beyond which 
		it was necessary to pack stores. Of the drive little is said, as nothing 
		could be seen at a distance of more than two or three miles, owing to 
		the smoke-haze from forest fires. After several days packing stores (and 
		various adventures) the party decided to attack Coppercrown, &quot;a fine-looking 
		peak of 10,218 feet which had never been ascended... Fifty miles to the 
		south the country has only been seen by prospectors and the odd trapper, 
		has never been photographed and is still unvisited by mountaineers. Of 
		course from the mountaineering standpoint the range is not difficult, 
		the highest peaks are only 11,000 feet odd, and none of them seems to 
		present great difficulty; the difficulties are more in approach than in 
		anything else.&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Thursday, 
		August 20th Left most of our dunnage on the camp site on Toby Creek trail 
		and packed food, blankets and tent up a prospector’s trail which runs 
		about four miles up Coppercrown Creek, but rises right up the side of 
		the valley to 7,600 feet... I was ready for lunch at 6.15 p.m. Things 
		looked bad from a point of view of climbing the mountain; it was still 
		2½ miles away, and though the rough map showed a straight mountain side, 
		there appeared to be ridges. After tea Mac went back for his boots while 
		I climbed to a peak of 8,600 feet, 2,000 feet above the camp, to reconnoitre. 
		It was impossible to reach Coppercrown by contour- in along the mountain 
		side; there were five ridges between the camp and the glacier on the west 
		of Coppercrown; of these only one was shown on the map. The ridges of 
		the mountain were steep and guarded with gendarmes, but the way of attack 
		seemed obvious – to take the glacier on its west flank and. work round 
		behind the mountain where the general form seemed to point to an easy 
		ridge, probably descending to a col. The only way to reach the mountain 
		was to descend a gully 1,600 feet to Coppercrown Creek, follow the creek 
		up to tree line near the snout of the glacier, camp, and climb the mountain 
		from the camp.&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;August 
		21st. After some consultation we decided to put my plans into action. 
		Taking only two blankets, my very light ground-sheet and food for a day 
		and a half, we descended to the creek, and worked up it, sometimes through 
		the beautiful thick timber, a pleasant change after the burnt stuff we 
		had been used to; sometimes in the bed of the stream, and sometimes through 
		the fireweed which purples the mountain after a slide. It is probable 
		that the creek has never been ascended before, though possibly some local 
		hunter has been up. Coppercrown looked grand, completely blocking the 
		head of the valley, stupendous cliffs swooping down to a hanging glacier, 
		below which were more cliffs. At the head of the valley fine cliffs walled 
		us in and over these the glacier streams fell in magnificent falls. Unfortunately 
		smoke again obscured the views. </P>
	  <P>We climbed 
		the moraine to tree-line, at about 7,200 feet, twenty minutes below the 
		snout of the glacier. There we found a hollow which I levelled into a 
		bed big enough for four. Mac cut balsam tree boughs and succeeded in making 
		the softest bed of the trip. While the girls were making the 6re and cooking 
		tea and tinned salmon I climbed to the glacier and across to its left 
		bank. From here I could see the glacier sloping up to a col of about 9,200 
		feet, and the summit of Coppercrown appearing above a subsidiary peak. 
		As I had expected, the summit ridge to the south was at an easy angle 
		without gendarmes. It seemed obvious that we must ascend to the col, from 
		which we could see our way clear to the summit. I returned to the camp, 
		as it started to rain... After a supper of salmon and bannock we turned 
		in at 7 p.m.&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;August 
		22nd. I was glad when the alarm went at 3.30 a.m., being deucedly uncomfortable... 
		it was 5.30 a.m. when we started. Lowering clouds were being driven across 
		the sky by a strong west wind; white fleecy clouds were gathering in the 
		valleys, a very bad sign, a few spots of rain fell, and the smoke gave 
		everything a weird, portentous look. It seemed very doubtful if we could 
		make the mountain before the weather broke, but the summits were dear. 
		Mac kindly gave me the lead, and we set off at an easy pace up the moraine. 
		On reaching the crevassed glacier we roped; but there were only two crevasses, 
		and I had to cut no more than about twenty steps, so we reached the col 
		quite easily. A small glacier lay zoo feet below us, and from it a snow 
		slope swept up the north-west face of the mountain, very steep in appearance; 
		but the west arete was a ’ cinch,’ disappointingly easy. We descended 
		to the glacier and found that the snow slope was at an easy angle and 
		presented the easiest means of approach. The snow was hard, but kicking 
		steps was sufficient; I led up this until we reached the broken rocks 
		above, and easy walking up these brought us to the summit, 10,218 feet, 
		at 8.50 a.m.&quot; </P>
	  <P>It was very 
		cold and snow was falling slightly, so we lost no time in building a cairn 
		and leaving a record in a tin box. </P>
	  <P>If it had 
		not been for the smoke the view would have been magnificent, as Coppercrown 
		is the highest peak within about ten miles, and should command a view 
		of the range for fifty miles either way. We saw some fine-looking peaks 
		to the south, hitherto unclimbed but probably not much above 10,000 feet. 
		</P>
	  <P>Well, that 
		was my first &quot; first ascent &quot;– as a climb it was nothing, the 
		difficulty lay in the approach and the reconnoit- ring, and that is where 
		most of the satisfaction lay... But unexplored country has a fascination 
		which makes up for the lack of technical difficulty in the climbing. </P>
	  <P>On the return 
		we glissaded the snow, but it was too hard for a good glissade... We returned 
		by the same route without incident but with great speed. We left the high 
		camp at 1.30 p.m. and followed the creek down. It was an awful grind up 
		to the trail, and the others headed for a little cabin at the bottom of 
		the creek, while I sweated up 500 feet for the dunnage we had left at 
		the first camp. Here snow was falling fast, and it seemed a desolate spot 
		indeed, perched high up on the mountains. At the cabin we soon had a roaring 
		fire in the store, changed our clothes, and after a supper of porridge, 
		soup, beans and coffee, turned in. </P>
