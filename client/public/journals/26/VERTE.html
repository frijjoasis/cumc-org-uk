		<H1>An attempt on the Verte </H1><HR>

	  <P>WE arrived 
		at the Couvercle hut in an unspeakable temper, for we had crossed the 
		Col des Cristaux in the blazing sun, and the soft snow on the glacier 
		had been nearly thigh deep. We were wet; we were hot; we were hungry and 
		altogether prepared to argue on any point from the use and abuse � especially 
		the abuse � of the rope to the bitter question whether two hours on the 
		top of the Col had been time enough for breakfast. Luckily, we had the 
		hut to ourselves with the exception of the guardian, an extremely silent 
		individual, who asked but two questions � � where we had come from? � 
		� when and where we were going ? � To our frayed tempers he seemed to 
		stress the �when.� After we had told him we were going to try the Verte 
		by the Moine ridge, he looked even more solemn, remarked that we would 
		never get on to the ridge, let alone to the summit, and that if we came 
		across any bodies they would be the last party who had attempted it. With 
		this cheery remark he lapsed into silence, and watched us broach and cook 
		half a tin of pemmican. Pemmican has to be seen to be appreciated and 
		tasted to be enjoyed; its smell when cold is its strong point, so that 
		the guardian could not be tempted to venture upon a mug in spite of our 
		assurances that after it he would want no further meal that night. </P>

		The Moine Ridge of the Verte</DIV>
	  <P>Scarce had 
		we gone to bed when a solemn guardian, remarking that it was midnight, 
		bade us arise. In a grim silence he watched us drink our tea and chew 
		at our bread, and then escorted us off the premises. </P>
	  <P>We regretfully 
		left him at 12.30 a.m. and, keeping well up under the ridge as it passes 
		from the Verte to the Moine, crossed the glacier. In this way we met with 
		but two crevasses of any size, and arrived at 2.30 at the great subsidiary 
		buttress that the ridge sends down into the glacier. We took the gully 
		on the left and kicked up to the bergschrund where the party, always unanimous, 
		had a second breakfast. </P>
	  <P>The schrund 
		was not easy. The leader stood on a pile of avalanche <I>d&eacute;bris</I>, 
		fixed his axe in the upper slope and struggled. He then demanded a shoulder; 
		putting the handle of the lantern in his mouth, he mounted on his second�s 
		shoulders. Unfortunately he had got but one knee on the upper lip when 
		he burnt his chin. </P>
	  <P>Having regained 
		that coolness of body and mind necessary in a leader, he cut a step in 
		the hard crust and took off on his second�s nose and pulled up. The second 
		was more graceful in his effort, and in a few minutes we were manfully 
		kicking up hard and steep snow. Half an hour of the snow and it became 
		ice, and the angle seemed high; glazed rock barred the gully ahead, so 
		that we were forced up a difficult chimney on the left wall. Here we met 
		trouble, as we had excellent practice in the art of climbing narrow chimneys 
		in heavy rucksacks. After half an hour�s profane delay we traversed back 
		into the gully only to meet .html obstacle some 300 feet higher up. 
		We then made the mistake of getting back on to the left wall; it was only 
		after an hour and a half of difficult chimneys, where the second man gave 
		shoulders and also used the rope in ways not mentioned in polite mountaineering 
		society, that we arrived at the point where the subsidiary buttress abutted 
		against the face, some 300 feet below the main ridge. </P>
	  <P>Traversing 
		left over glazed slabs we hit a deep cleft which led directly to the ridge. 
		Half way up this we were brought to a stand by a steep, exposed slab some 
		70 feet in length, up which V. N. led; at no point was it less difficult 
		than Slanting Gully Slab Lliwedd, and was the <I>bonne bouche</I> of the 
		climb. We thus came out upon the main ridge, where a casual glance at 
		the communal watch showed us that if we wished to get within striking 
		distance of our summit we should have to mend our pace. </P>
	  <P>Ahead of 
		us we expected to find a sound ridge which Mummery describes as an excellent 
		rock climb. As far as we could see it looked more like snow than rock. 
		About every fifty feet an imposing gendarme stood manfully out of a thin 
		unstable snow ridge. We climbed on a long rope and moved one at a time. 
		The second would attach himself to a gendarme, and the leader would delicately 
		pick his way across the snow to the next piece of rock. This was slow 
		but entertaining; twice the leader took a shoulder to climb a gendarme, 
		and, having played his second man round the steep glazed rocks at the 
		base, doubled off the other side. As the ridge grew steeper the movement 
		between the gendarmes became more difficult and the pace of the party, 
		never fast, began to be inappreciable., The sun was hot; the snow was 
		sticky, and gradually it became impressed on us that it would be a near 
		thing if we got our peak. At 1.15 p.m.. the leader passed a rather more 
		incoherent and steeper piece of snow and failed to find a good stand; 
		we both together voiced our opinion that if we carried on up that ridge 
		.html hour, we would spend the night out. </P>
	  <P>We lunched 
		sorrowfully off a sardine, while we decided that turn we must, for we 
		both were soaking from lying and wading in the wet snow, and a night high 
		up would not be comfortable, if nothing worse. Although we were. well 
		above Les Droites and only some 400 feet from our summit, it would have 
		taken us at least an hour and a half in the condition of the rocks or, 
		rather snow. We tossed for the privilege of imbibing the oil out of the 
		tin, wriggled into our rucksacks, adjusted our wet clothes so as to touch 
		in as few places as possible, and started down. We did not feel happy 
		about it, so we quoted the classics on the subject to each other till 
		we felt in a better frame of mind. </P>
	  <P>We had given 
		a fair allowance of time for the descent, as we had expected to find the 
		snow on the ridge requiring even more care, as it was now the hottest 
		part of the afternoon. Twice the leader started incipient avalanches, 
		but by keeping to the rule that one of the party should be on rock, we 
		felt quite secure and, as it was, we were only compelled to move together 
		on snow for a short 150 feet. However, apart from this, our flounderings 
		of the morning seemed to have consolidated the ridge and, moving one at 
		a time, we reached the top of the subsidiary buttress at 6.30. When we 
		had doubled a rope over any and every pitch on the upper part of the buttress 
		we entered the top of the couloir at 7 p.m. One glance convinced us that 
		at that time of the day it was no place for a self- respecting party, 
		so that we kept on down the buttress and, to our delight, found it easier 
		than we had expected. At the foot there was no schrund, and we arrived 
		on the glacier in the dark. </P>
	  <P>Mummery 
		records that it took him only a few minutes from here to the Couvercle; 
		but those were heroic days, or else the snow was in very different condition, 
		for it took us an hour and a quarter stumbling in deep snow to reach the 
		hut, even though we were buoyed up by visions of steaming pemmican. The 
		Guardian, Simond, met us with a smile and seemed almost pleased to see 
		us. He offered us a tinned � tunny � which we gratefully bought from him. 
		It was a weird beast, but proved a welcome change from our pemmican. We 
		lit our pipes, but woke up to find Simond leading us gently but firmly 
		to bed. </P>
