		<H1>The Oasis </H1><HR>
		<H2>J. L. Longland </H2>
		<H3>Jesus College </H3>
	  
	  <P>THE party 
		were descending Pillar in the cool of the day; at least to all reasonable 
		men it should have been the cool of the day, but the leader had been energetic 
		and soulless, and his rebellious following had for once trailed behind 
		in a state of drugged complaisance. </P>
	  <P>They had 
		stood on the summit of High Man more times in one day than any other mortal, 
		except Mr. Kelly, does in the course of a climbing season, and this not 
		through any exceptional speed or agility on their part, but by stolidly 
		struggling up the succession of short and easy climbs that have been provided 
		on the East side of the rock. They had not even paused once during their 
		many visits to the top for the traditional game of giving fictitious names 
		with a weighty air to all the multitude of hills and tarns that could 
		be seen, as the day, though hot, had been wonderfully clear. </P>
	  <P>They had 
		eaten immoderately of the various parching foodstuffs that are common 
		to climbing expeditions as to picnics, but – and here we approach the 
		heart of the matter – they had not drunk since well before midday. For 
		on the way along the High Level Path in the morning they had tried to 
		forestall the thirst to come by using a small stream that crosses the 
		track: there is a little rock cup, set right in the very path, and through 
		it a constant trickle of cool water Bows; there you can drink with none 
		of the discomfort usual to mountain streams, slowly – in the way that 
		pleases you best, without gasps for breath or the icy cascade that runs 
		up your sleeves, no matter how you stoop. You know it well. You, too, 
		have panted up the grassy steeps of Looking Stead on the way to Pillar, 
		cursing the quixotic scruples that made you pass by the ample waters of 
		Gathrestone Beck with such determined aversion of your perspiring faces. 
		Then, when through ages of time you have tramped sturdily along the High 
		Level, till you seem to have come almost to the shadow of Robinson’s Cairn, 
		you light upon it, this rill of comfort set in a waterless land. </P>
	  <P>So evening 
		finds our party clambering down from Jordan Gap to get to the path, and 
		in the heated brain of the Leader was burnt the memory of that stream 
		of the morning and he was filled with a determination to endure his great 
		thirst till he should quench it worthily at those pleasant waters. So 
		to please a whim was the die cast. for to his view it would have seemed 
		unlucky in the extreme to drink at any other place, wherefore we shall 
		from now on call him the Superstitious Man. </P>
	  <P>Now you 
		shall hear the true wickedness of the Superstitious Man, and gloat with 
		us over his subsequent misery. He was one who had by heart all a leader’s 
		possible privileges, and always he sought to increase his authority over 
		those who were fortunate enough to climb behind him, while he conscientiously 
		avoided such menial tasks as coiling the rope or carrying a rucksack. 
		He remembered how far and how toilsome of approach the stream had been 
		that morning, and considered that to return there was a short and easy 
		journey. Here was his chance to improve the discipline of his party with 
		little discomfort to himself, and his decree went out that there should 
		be no drinking till the stream was reached. </P>
	  <P>His followers 
		set out along the path in an attitude of suppressed rebellion, and were 
		resolutely hurried past several tempting trickles. The way began to lengthen 
		out, and with it the face of the Superstitious Man. Suppose the stream 
		had already been passed? Insidious suggestion; and yet he began to range 
		ahead, for if it were not found his authority would be for ever gone. 
		His mind recalled the stories of his youth, stories of mirages in the 
		desert where visions of faery pools had lured on unfortunate travellers. 
		ht each turn in the path, and you must be in like case to know how viciously 
		serpentine such a path can become, there was a prospect of little dells 
		and hollows where might lark water and the salvation of his credit; each 
		of these when reached proved more arid than the last. Remorse ate into 
		his heart at the thought of all the cool streams his foolish pride had 
		passed, now in memory swelled to what delectable size and number. </P>
	  <P>Now there 
		was also a Reasonable Man, he who knew to a nicety the right proportion 
		between his girth and the width of a chimney, and who refused to stir 
		if he considered that at any time this equation could not be solved; moreover, 
		he disliked the voice of authority. He began now to bewail that he had 
		passed thirsty by so many excellent waters through .html man’s folly, 
		and to express his intention of drinking at the next source, however meagre. 
		For this de6ance the Superstitious Man turned and rent him, denounced 
		his sordid materialism, and dubbed him a Heretic. But the Heretic was 
		supported by the Feminine Element, who, though a novice, had throughout 
		showed a very proper con- tempt for her leader’s judgment and ability, 
		and had not the Philosopher, the fourth member of the party, maintained 
		his usual aloof and uncomplaining pose, it might have gone ill with the 
		Superstitious Man. </P>
	  <P>As it was, 
		he continued the interminable trudge with outward dignity, though tortured 
		by a parched throat and the blow to his authority, till the slope of Looking 
		Stead loomed before him, and all hope of salvation seemed to have fled. 
		</P>
	  <P>Yet our 
		tale, as all tales should, must have its happy ending; and as he dejectedly 
		rounded what appeared to be the last and most unpromising turn of the 
		path, there before him flowed the blessed stream. He turned in triumph 
		– gone were remorse and humility – struck a Napoleonic attitude, and in 
		a few chosen words gathered up the shreds of his broken prestige, while 
		even the Heretic, when dignity should have constrained him to pass by 
		on the other side, bowed his ponderous form to the ground, and lapped 
		like a dog, </P>
