	  <P>ON the 17th 
		of July eleven members of the Cambridge Club met at the Hotel du Pigne 
		at Arolla in the Val d'H&eacute;rens. The President and Secretary 
		had come from three weeks' successful climbing in the Mont Blanc 
		Massif, and two others, also in good training, had come by way of the 
		Rhine and the Black Forest. The rest had crossed France in a very crowded 
		third class railway carriage, and had no doubt been broken in to greater 
		discomforts than the mountains were likely to give, but their general 
		condition had not been improved by the journey, despite a solemn training 
		walk in full kit from the Gare du Nord to the Gare de Lyon. Besides this 
		variety in training there were also differences in the matter of experience, 
		for some members of the meet had never been in the Alps before. That a 
		fair estimate of the success of the meet may be made, the unsettled state 
		of the weather should also be emphasised. On those days on which climbing 
		was possible, there was often a clouding over at midday, followed by rain 
		or snow, which tended rather to curtail expeditions. </P>

	  <P>As we arrived 
		in the evening of Friday, starts were as late as 6.0 a.m. on the following 
		day. The secretary took his party over the Petite Dent de Veisivi, which 
		they found to be an excellent ridge traverse on rock as sound as Pillar 
		or Gable. The other two parties decided that what they principally needed 
		was experience of snow and ice. Consequently the President's and 
		Treasurer's parties struggled over the three snow cols, the Col du 
		Collon, the Col de L'Ev&ecirc;que, and the Col des Vignettes. The 
		day was muggy with low mist, and the snow conditions so unsatisfactory 
		that afterwards there was less keenness about practising snow and ice 
		work. </P>
	  <P>On the next 
		day Van Noorden's party made an adventurous traverse of the Douves 
		Blanches and the Tsa. On the ar&ecirc;te just before reaching the Tsa 
		two massive slabs of rock, between which the party had begun to move, 
		started to close up on the second man, who made a leap into the air, and 
		the rock jaws bit at the rope only, which was cut in two. There was also 
		a hurried descent of three of 'the party down the couloir on the 
		west face of the Tsa, but as each bounced down the President gently fielded 
		them and placed them on a safe ledge. Wager's party climbed the Cime 
		M&eacute;ridionale of the Aiguilles Rouges by way of the couloir leading 
		to the Col de Slingsby. They returned the same way as far as the Col de 
		Slingsby, and then went down the Ar&ecirc;te de la Mangette, which was 
		made of soft mica schist totally unlike the splendid rock of the Cime 
		M&eacute;ridionale. The Secretary's party attempted the Mont Collon, 
		but the eggs eaten for lunch made the party turn when they were quite 
		near the top. </P>
	  <P>A &quot;jour 
		de repos&quot; was spent in over-eating in the traditional way. Some climbers 
		are known to object to the continued harping on the subject of food, but 
		they are probably in the minority, and therefore it shall be explained 
		that the President and Secretary, being old hands at the game, arrived 
		before the rest on the first day of the meet, and they were not only found 
		by a tired and hungry party to have annexed the two best beds, but at 
		dinner the President's and Secretary's chairs were hard by the 
		kitchen door. It was a great satisfaction to the remoter members at the 
		dining table to find this latter precaution was unnecessary, as Monsieur 
		Bovier:, the proprietor, actually encouraged the practice of over- eating. 
		After lunch, therefore, on this first off-day there was a very general 
		feeling of shame, and a party went down the valley, climbed the Dent de 
		Satarme, and bathed in the Lac Bleu, while two others cut some way up 
		the Glacier du Mont Collon ice fall. The feeling of shame did not extend 
		to the President and Secretary, and they marked the occasion by two ' 
		Th&eacute;s complets.' </P>
	  <P>On the following 
		day the parties resumed their labours and Harris repeated his attempt 
		on the Mont Collon and traversed it. They went up by the west ar&ecirc;te 
		and down by the </P>
	  <P>Chancelier 
		ridge. At the bottom of the ridge the leader made an attempt to teach 
		the art of glissading. He went down first, belayed himself comfortably, 
		gave the rope a sharp jerk, and shouted instructions as the members of 
		his party rolled past. The President's party traversed the Cime M&eacute;ridionale 
		of the Aiguilles Rouges from the Col Sud nearly to the Col de Slingsby 
		and down the face a little to the North of the couloir, as the latter 
		was throwing stones. The Treasurer's party failed on the Dent Perroc. 
		After endless loose rock and very little climbing, on the ridge which 
		comes down towards Arolla, an enormous boulder slithered down rather close 
		to one of the party. This made them move very slowly, and they turned 
		near the top just before a snow storm broke. </P>
	  <P>The parties 
		now went to three separate huts. One party on the way up to the Bertol 
		hut found an unfortunate guide carrying one large rucksack, one small 
		one, a large cloak, and attached to his coat-tail his employer, a retired 
		German general. As the pace was slow they refrained from hanging on too. 
		They made a three o'clock start for the Bouquetins, but impossible 
		weather turned them at 6 a.m., and they went back to Arolla. For the next 
		three days they made early starts for the Tsa, but on each occasion they 
		were turned by the weather. Another party started after lunch for the 
		hut in the Val des Dix. At the top of the Pas de Ch&egrave;vres they found 
		two disconsolate tourists from Sion, who had slept the night out and lacked 
		the necessary courage to brave the difficulties of the pass. They refused 
		all offers of help, and what ultimately became of them is not known. On 
		a fairly hopeless morning they left the Val des Dix hut hoping to climb 
		Mont Blanc de Seilon, but at the Col de Serpentine, after having made 
		their way up the ice fall, they were turned by the weather, and they eventually 
		returned to Arolla by the Pas de Ch&egrave;vres. </P>
	  <P>The third 
		party from the invariably crowded Jenkins hut on the Col des Vignettes 
		were able to make a later start. This fitted in better with the idiosyncrasies 
		of the weather, and Donkin, who had just come out from England, led the 
		party over the Petit Mont Collon. It was remarkable that while the other 
		mountains in the neighbourhood were in thick cloud, the Petit Mont Collon 
		was more often in sunshine. As there was some doubt of the standard route, 
		the party made an interesting way up the southern end of the Peak. </P>
	  <P>Subsequently 
		the Douves Blanches and Tsa was climbed by the Secretary's party. 
		The President's depleted party traversed the Petite Dent de Veisivi, 
		descending the Tour Rouge without the use of a doubled rope. The Treasurer's 
		party climbed the Haute Cime of the Aiguilles Rouges, and also traversed 
		the popular Petite Dent de Veisivi. On the last day of the meet a compound 
		of the remains of the various parties, with the addition of Kempson, started 
		in doubtful weather for the Mont Collon. Half way up the moraine of the 
		Pi&egrave;ce Glacier heavy rain came on, and the party sat down round 
		the glacier lantern. Three of them watched the rain frizzle on the top 
		of the lantern, and two curled up to keep warm and succeeded in going 
		off to sleep. In half an hour the watchers had not decided to return to 
		bed, and the rain began to stop; after threequarters of an hour, when 
		we were beginning to dry, more by luck than determination the party started 
		up instead of down the track. The weather cleared, and a perfect day was 
		spent in the traverse of the Collon. </P>
	  <P>With this, 
		the official meet ended, but there was a rearrangement of parties and 
		a scattering in different directions. Their subsequent history may be 
		briefly described. One party left for the Bertol hut <I>en route</I> for 
		Zermatt. Another went up the Tsa by the West face and down to Bricolla. 
		Bad weather here prevented them carrying out their programme, so they 
		crossed to Zermatt and climbed the Wellenkuppe and Obergabelhorn in a 
		snow storm. The remainder of the party some days later traversed the Monte 
		Rosa with an entertaining but mad Italian porter. The third party went 
		down the Otemma glacier to Chanrion climbing La Sangla on the way. In 
		the bad weather that followed they zig-zagged across frontier cols to 
		the Italian Val Ferret, from which they managed one climb during a week's 
		stay. This suggested more col walking, which took them eventually to the 
		Central Graians, and on a last hurried day they traversed the Ciamarella 
		and Albaron. </P>
	  <P>The Meet 
		was a success, for it attained the results for which a meet in the Alps 
		was originally intended. A meet on the lines followed by the Cambridge 
		Mountaineering Club enables the expense of a climbing holiday to be reduced 
		by the cost of hiring guides. Though the saving of expense was the alleged 
		justification for the first meet arranged by L. A. Ellwoad in the Alps 
		in 1923, yet the greatest value of these meets undoubtedly is that they 
		provide guideless climbing. Those who have a little more experience in 
		the Alps form a party with one or two of less experience and, of course, 
		only easy climbs are attempted; as a result the party is of a different 
		nature from any ordinary guided party. The leader has at an early stage 
		the responsibilities and delights of leadership, and the others, for whom 
		the Meet is primarily designed, share some of the feeling of responsibility, 
		learn something of route finding. Such a party will work better as a unit 
		than one formed of a guide, a porter, and two beginners. </P>
	  <P>The party 
		is usually able to deal adequately with the rock on the easier climbs 
		because its members have had some practice in the Lake District or Wales, 
		and all that they have to learn at first is care on loose rock and speed 
		an easy rock. On snow and ice it is otherwise, and the leader will not 
		only be over-cautious, but his technique will always be clumsy or bad 
		when compared with that of a guide. On the whole, however, this tends 
		to produce a safer and better attitude towards mountaineering than difficult 
		expeditions led by a good guide, whose rapid and accurate judgment of 
		conditions prevents the beginner from realizing many of the dangers of 
		climbing, and whose skill masks the difficulties of the technique. It 
		is for these reasons, and also because it is an enjoyable communal activity 
		of the Club, that the summer Meet exists. </P>
