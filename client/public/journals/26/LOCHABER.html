	  <P>THE spirit 
		of exploration plays a large part in Mountaineering, for mountaineers 
		are for the most part travellers who find a fascination in discovering 
		for themselves secluded valleys and unspoilt villages as well as a forcing 
		routes up new peaks and unfamiliar glaciers. </P>
	  <P>But when 
		in strange parts, most climbers are content to follow in the footsteps 
		of their predecessors by using Maps and Climbing Guides: this they do 
		as a precautionary measure, knowing that in districts which have been 
		explored in detail, a climbing day can be better spent by obeying instructions 
		than by trusting to Providence. With most of us, time is limited, and 
		the interest of unaided route finding is not considered worth the risk 
		of disappointment. </P>

		Sgor A'Mhaim and Stob Ban</DIV>
	  <P>The Lakeland 
		Fells are the easiest mountains for most of us to reach. These, unlike 
		Alpine peaks, have little individuality as mountains, the great interest 
		being in the rock faces. So climbers find themselves continually following 
		the tracks to some half-dozen crags where the rocks are ’good and where 
		the best routes are charted The time then soon comes when every changing 
		view is familiar; one no longer feels that exquisite joy of breasting 
		some new col to see a great panorama of new peaks burst into view. The 
		rock-climber is thus apt to slip into that much criticised state of complete 
		indifference to scenery, being interested only in the purely technical 
		and gymnastic side of climbing. </P>
	  <P>We look 
		also to the hills to give us contrast to the crowded places of the earth, 
		and freedom from the company of all but the closest of friends. Here, 
		alas, the Lakes suffer by reason of this very accessibility, and it is 
		rarely, except in winter, that one can spend a day in the fells completely 
		alone. </P>
	  <P>The remedy 
		is to come at &quot;off seasons&quot; when the &quot;Tourist&quot; is 
		blissfully ignorant that the Lakes have still some attractions. Happily 
		the most crowded season is August, which, among the fells, is quite the 
		least attractive month in the year. Come rather in the sun and snow of 
		early Spring, and in the Autumn, when the fell sides are rich with the 
		red-brown of dying bracken, and then in the sweltering haze of Summer 
		one need not be interested in the dull-green hills; one can forget the 
		crowded passes and the hotels by the lakes, and can live for the touch 
		of warm dry rocks. </P>
	  <P>Some go 
		rather to Wales – to the lonely cwms and the less exploited peaks, where 
		there is peace: but in the valleys it is hard to escape the far-reaching 
		charabanc, whose influence has ruined so many wayside inns. </P>
	  <P>Others go 
		to Scotland – and here is a land where the explorer can find everything 
		that makes the mountains of our own islands so fascinating: Rock peaks 
		rising from the sea, or from great open moorland where no man comes; lakes 
		set like gems among the birch and pine-woods, or running like Norwegian 
		Fjords into the heart of snow- capped mountains. Here is a country which 
		is for ever calling the climber back to explore some new district which 
		he saw tempting him from the last peak of his previous visit. </P>
	  <P>Thus inspired, 
		we determined that Glencoe and Lochaber must be explored in winter conditions. 
		The perfect snow and sun of the Lakes at the Meet in March gave promise 
		of wonderful things in the Highlands, so thither we travelled. I collected 
		Manley at Bridge of Orchy Station, and took him on the back of the machine 
		to Clachaig. </P>
	  <P>Clachaig 
		is a well situated little inn for the climber; lying below the great wall 
		of Aonach. Dubh which seems to bar the entrance to the deep and gloomy 
		Glencoe. But it is far to Buchaille Etive, and here, as in most Scottish 
		centres, a car or cycle is of enormous value. </P>
	  <P>Our first 
		few days there were days of bitter disappointment. It snowed and rained 
		almost incessantly: we never saw the peaks, and the valleys were less 
		attractive than in summer, when the birch trees and green bracken form 
		so delicate a foreground to mist-shrouded hills. The third morning was 
		as hopeless as ever, but desperation drove us to attempt Bidean nam Bian 
		(3,766 ft.), the highest of the Glencoe Peaks. We soon reached snow and 
		mist, and a strong gusty wind. The mist grew denser, and the ridge narrowed 
		down and steepened, we were soon groping our way over ice- caked rocks 
		and little cols with huge cornices – how we longed for that rope we had 
		scorned to bring! At last we reached the summit, and a world of whiteness, 
		with mist blending into snow giving a strange sensation that one was poised 
		in cloud, having no contact with the earth. We abandoned the traverse 
		across to Stob Coire an Lochan, for this meant getting through the cornice 
		– not a pleasant thought when nothing was visible below. So we came down 
		the West side down snow gullies and steep grassy slopes below, into a 
		wild and barren glen, and back to Clachaig. We came back with a very great 
		respect for Scottish peaks, having made the mistake of treating Bidean 
		as if it were a Lakeland peak, just a little higher. </P>
	  <P>Time being 
		limited, this bad weather compelled us to abandon plans of looking at 
		Skye in winter conditions, and feeling very disappointed, we moved to 
		Fort William in hopes of better things. </P>
	  <P>The Meteorologist’s 
		prophecies were correct. We drove to Achintee wild with delight at the 
		prospect of a really good day, for the clouds were breaking up, and the 
		wind was in the North. Ever cautious, though, we made a short detour to 
		the top of Meall an’t Suidhe (2,322 ft.) to get the view lest it should 
		cloud over again. </P>
	  <P>Every snow-capped 
		peak as far as the eye could see glittered in the sun: the great brown 
		valley lay below us, and Loch Linnhe stretched far away to distant Mull. 
		The peaks of Ardgour especially looked most attractive. </P>
	  <P>We were 
		soon rounding the corner into the Mhuillinn Glen, and the vast North face 
		of Ben Nevis began to come into view. We lunched by the stream in deep 
		soft snow, and contemplated the big slope before us. There was 2,000 ft. 
		of step-kicking up hard steep snow – and most tiring it was, for the snow 
		was so hard that three or four kicks were needed to make an adequate foot-hold. 
		The view back across the , Corrie was of a grandeur unapproached by anything 
		either of us had seen in Britain: two thousand feet of crags, and nearly 
		two miles wide: ridges and gullies, all plastered in ice and snow glittering 
		with a metallic sheen in the misty sun; plastered so thickly that no trace 
		of dark rock showed through the icy covering. We decided there and then 
		that all climbing on these crags was out of the question. How Van Noorden’s 
		party fared is described elsewhere – four desperate days were spent in 
		an attempt to force the Tower Ridge. We lunched on Carn Mor Dearg, our 
		first Scottish 4,000 ft. peak, sheltering under the cairn from the drifting 
		snow, while we viewed the ridge ahead. This ridge to Ben Nevis is surely 
		the most attractive ridge in Britain; it is a ridge of perfect symmetry, 
		starting from the shapely peak of Carn Mor Dearg, and curving up behind 
		the huge pinnacle-like North East Buttress which merges into the summit 
		plateau of Ben Nevis, while beyond are those great crags. From the ridge, 
		.html goo ft. of hard steep snow brought us to the top: the highest 
		point in Britain. We looked around for the observatory, but all was bare 
		and smooth, except for two small hummocks of ice. Prolonged hacking at 
		one of these with an ice-axe disclosed the stonework of a chimney! Life 
		must have been hard for those who used to dwell here all the year round. 
		</P>
	  <P>Ben Nevis 
		is disappointing as a view point. One sees an incredible distance. I have 
		seen Uist in the Outer Hebrides – nearly zoo miles, but the impression 
		is of an endless sea of peaks receding away to infinity. The eye is bewildered 
		and the outline of any one peak is marred by the distraction of the one 
		beyond. The Mamore Forest peaks in particular, suffered: they had looked 
		very fine from Meall an’t Suidhe, now far below. It was bitterly cold, 
		with a strong North wind blowing: so cold that my boots were frozen stiff 
		on my feet. In the gathering dusk we looked timidly over the fearsome 
		cornices above the crags. There must have been 40 feet of vertical ice 
		barring the finish to the Tower Ridge. Then we came down nearly 2,000 
		feet in sitting glissades – a delightful method of descending on Scottish 
		snow, which is generally either very hard or too soft and powdery for 
		standing glissades. We came down so quickly (aided along the road by the, 
		motor cycle) that we arrived in Fort William still covered in snow, to 
		the astonishment of the inhabitants, who had enjoyed a warm sunny day.

		Bidean Nam Bian and Glencoe Peaks from Mamore Forest</DIV>
	  <P>We drove 
		up Glen Nevis on a superb morning. The snow- capped peaks gleamed in the 
		sun, dazzling white against the pure blue sky, and the last cloud was 
		rolling off Sgor a’ Mhaim. Glen Nevis is a fine valley: it has been described 
		as &quot;truly Alpine,&quot; and indeed with such snow on the tops, the 
		comparison is almost justified, although the characteristic atmosphere 
		of a Scottish glen is never lost. It is a perfect valley for a camp. </P>
	  <P>It was so 
		wonderful in the valley that we lingered till past midday before we started 
		leisurely up the broad ridge which leads to Mullach na Coirean, the last 
		of the Mamore mountains, and a splendid viewpoint. The Glencoe peaks eight 
		miles away were singularly fine, and we could trace the upper part of 
		our recent route up Bidean. </P>
	  <P>We followed 
		the ridge eastwards, on hard level snow at first, which steepened for 
		the final cone of Stob Ban, where step-kicking was needed. Stob Ban is 
		a striking little peak – ’ though little only by comparison with its loftier 
		neighbours. In Summer its quartzite top is conspicuous from afar, but 
		in Winter no rocks are visible, and the summit is just a sharp corniced 
		peak. We stood there in the evening sun wishing we had left time to do 
		that grand looking ridge to Sgor a’Mhaim. But we had learnt our lesson 
		on Bidean, and had now sufficient respect for Scottish snow peaks to deter 
		us from the unpleasant- ness of descending 3,500 feet in the dark. The 
		Mamore Forest ridges are certainly worthy of thorough exploration - especially 
		in snow conditions. More sitting glissades took us down into a fine rock-encirded 
		corrie, and thence by a charming side valley back to Glen Nevis, and so 
		to Fort William. </P>
	  <P>Our short 
		spell of good weather was ended. We had hoped to try Binnein Mor, but 
		now it would have meant a long day in wind and snow, so we went 18 miles 
		along the Mallaig road to the head of Loch Shiel. This part of the High- 
		lands, between Lochaber and Skye, contains probably some of the most beautiful 
		valley scenery in Britain, and is full of charming lochs among wooded 
		rocky hillsides. The peaks are not high, so by coming here we hoped for 
		the best of the weather. </P>
	  <P>We walked 
		up Glenfinnan, and up a bleak, slabby corrie to the top, and foun4 the 
		summit of Sgor na Coireachan (3,133 ft.) in dense mist. There was a gale 
		from the east driving the biting snow with such force that we could scarcely 
		face it, so we came down on the west side, and down a strange long valley, 
		with great smooth crags rising into the mist on either side. We came then 
		upon a most beautiful lake – Loch Beoraid it is called – set amid steep 
		slopes with birch woods and grassy glades, where we saw any number of 
		deer. The rain was in our faces for eight miles back to the road, and 
		we were cold and wet to the skin for the long drive home: a hot bath brought 
		us back to life, and we thanked Heaven we were not camping that night. 
		</P>
	  <P>’This is 
		all that is worthy of note. One more wet day was spent in that fascinating 
		gorge of Glen Nevis, and plans for Ben Lui on the way home were abandoned. 
		</P>
	  <P>So we had 
		only two fine days in nine – but some of the bad days were well spent, 
		for there is intense satisfaction in getting up a strange peak in bad 
		conditions – and those two days gave us something more wonderful than 
		we had believed was possible in our own country. </P>
