		<H1>Cambridge University Mountaineering Club</H1><HR>
		<H2>P. D. Thomas</H2>
		<H3>Emmanuel College</H3>
	  
	  <P>THERE 
		has been a series of lectures throughout the year which have covered a 
		wide range of districts, as the following shows. 
	  <P>During the 
		October Term Mr. S. Constable (O.U.M.C.) read on "Climbing in the Valais"; 
		Mr. A. E. Field on "The English Lake District"; Mr. D. R. Pye on "The 
		Dolomites"; and Mr. B. R. Goodfellow on "Climbing in Scotland." During 
		the Lent Term Mr. G. W. Young read on " Ridges and Failures "; Mr. G. 
		A. Solly on " The Caucasus "; Mr. Charles Brook on "The Dauphine Alps." 
		During the May Term Mr. Walter Weston read on " The Eiger Joch without 
		Guides "; and finally in the October Term Mr. H. E. L. porter read on 
		the "New Zealand Alps"; Mr. A. E. Storr on "The Pyrenees"; and Mr. C. 
		M. Sleeman on "Climbing in the Tyrol." 
	  <P>As the Easter 
		meet of the previous year was held in North Wales, in 1925 it was in the 
		Lake District. On March 23rd, eighteen members of the Club settled down 
		in varying degrees of luxury at Wasdale Head. Some of us inhabited a barn 
		at Burnthwaite, others camped in the usual places near Ritson's Force, 
		while the more opulent stayed either at the Hotel, Burnthwaite, or Middle 
		Row. 
	  <P>The weather 
		was at first cold with intervals of wind and sleet, but the sun was never 
		far away. The gullies were well filled with snow or ice, and gave ample 
		opportunity for the use of the axe. After five days the sun shone brightly, 
		cleared all the Napes Ridges of snow, and made them dry and warm, and 
		here all the ropes assembled.</P>

		Pike's Crag, Easter 1925</DIV>
	  <P>For interesting 
		snow conditions, however, Scawfell claimed superiority., and in Deep Ghyll 
		there remained only ten feet of the first pitch, while the second was 
		practically non-existent. Broad Stand was covered by a thin layer of ice, 
		and was by no means an easy way down. C. and D. gullies, Pike's Crag, 
		were also conquered, the former on one occasion involving operations which 
		would have been made much easier had the leader carried a windlass. Skew 
		Ghyll was found to be an interesting and amusing route to the Great End 
		gullies on which some attacks were made. Van Noorden and Thomas on the 
		first day, were turned in Cust's gulley by a young avalanche, though it 
		was climbed later. 
	  <P>Pillar, 
		with the High Level track in itself a mountaineering expedition, was covered 
		in snow, the short climbs on the East side, together with Shamrock Buttress, 
		being found the best for those new to climbing. 
	  <P>The sixth 
		day, sunny and dry, was spent by all on the Napes Ridges. The top block 
		of the needle offered its limited space to several strangers, and photographers 
		rejoiced at the opportunity offered by parallel parties on the three ridges. 
		
	  <P>During the 
		day Van Noorden and Thomas looked down from some threequarters of the 
		way up the Ling Chimney, to welcome the as yet clean-shaven secretary, 
		who had just arrived with Dr. Clark-Kennedy. A few minutes later a second 
		glance showed them already "girdling" the Needle. Some few had to leave 
		early on the last day, and the secretary volunteered to take the remainder 
		of Van Noorden's and Thomas's ropes, enabling them with Dr. Clark-Kennedy 
		to wander over to Pillar. </P>
	  <DIV ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="NEEDLE.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="389" ALT="Nape's Needle" ALIGN=CENTER><BR>
		The Needle </DIV>
	  <P>While contentedly 
		scrambling up after "doing " the North East climb, Mayo was seen on the 
		top of Shamrock Buttress with a green and anxious face. It appeared that 
		he was just recovering from the shock of hearing a dull thud after some 
		re-roping, and with relief had seen, at the bottom of the climb, one of 
		the member's rucksacs instead of the member himself, At the end of the 
		day this accident was the means of discovering an unfamiliar recipe for 
		a very attractive compound - bananas and ginger. 
	  <P>So ended 
		a most cheerful and successful meet. Not that the general standard of 
		the climbs was of any great difficulty, for weather, if nothing else, 
		prevented this; but those new to climbing left with a burning desire to 
		be at grips with the rocks again. 
	  <P>At Christmas 
		several members went to Norway and others to Scotland where ski-ing took 
		the place of rock-climbing. After the Easter meet two parties went to 
		the Ben Nevis district, where a three days' attempt on the Tourer Ridge 
		failed because of the snow conditions, and despite nine hours actually 
		on the ridge on the last day. An account of the Summer meet is given separately, 
		but both before and after the meet there were climbing parties in Wales 
		and the Lake District. 
	  <P>The officers 
		for 1925-1926 are: President, L. R. Wager (Pembroke); Honorary Secretaries, 
		P. D. Thomas (Emmanuel) and F. C. Mayo (Pembroke); Honorary Treasurer, 
		J. L. Longland (Jesus). </P>
