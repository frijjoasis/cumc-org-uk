		<H1>Preface</H1><HR>
		
	  <P>IN 
		producing "Cambridge Mountaineering" we feel that some explaination is 
		due. The Journal this year differs from other previous joint University 
		productions insomuch as it is more purely a domestic publication, and 
		is intended less for general reading than for members of the C.U.M.C. 
		If it should be read outside the University we can only hope that it will 
		meet with that forbearance shown to its more ambitious predecessors. 
	  <P>It is hoped 
		that this journal will not in any way predjudice the continuance of the 
		"Oxford and Cambridge Mountaineering" series. 
	  <P>We wish 
		to thank the Alpine Club for the loan of blocks; Capt. J. P. Farrar for 
		help in proof reading; Mr. S. Spenser for his photograph of the Verte, 
		and , finally, Mr. P. D. Thomas for his help with the advertising.<BR>
