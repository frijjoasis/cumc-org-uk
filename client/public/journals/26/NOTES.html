		<H1>Notes </H1><HR>
	    <H2>Central Norway </H2>
	  <P>TO those 
		who are inclined to yield to the temptation of visiting some extra-Alpine 
		climbing ground, and are turning their attention to Central Norway, this 
		note may be of interest. It is based upon experience acquired during a 
		visit to that district in August, 1925. </P>
	  <P>The highest 
		mountain group in Central Norway is the Jotunheim, any climbing-centre 
		of which may be approached from Bergen by more or less circuitous routes. 
		The Central Jotunheim can be reached within 24 hours from Oslo. If one 
		takes the night train to Otta one should be able to motor next morning 
		to Lom and R&ouml;isheim, and walk during the evening to the Spiterstul 
		Hut in the Visdal at the foot of the Galdh&ouml;pigg, the highest mountain 
		of Norway, 8,077 feet. But it is the Western Jotunheim, or rather the 
		group known as the Horunger, which offers the most attractive climbing. 
		Its centre is Turtagr&ouml; which is only about 10 m. from the landing 
		station on the Lyster or Sogne-Fjord called Skjolden, accessible by local 
		steamer services from Bergen. </P>
	  <P>The Jotunheim 
		is well supplied with huts of the chalet-hotel variety which are generally 
		comfortable, and in August of last year were not too crowded. It must 
		be admitted that (except in the Horunger) really good climbing needs to 
		be looked for as many of the peaks are rounded and dull, Incidentally 
		the nomenclature is some guide: thus one may expect a Tind, Pigg or Horn 
		to be steeper than a H&ouml;. But good climbs can be found e.g. the N.W. 
		face of the Galdh&ouml;pigg, The N.E. face and ridge of the Styggeh&ouml;, 
		the Knuthulstind from Knutshullet, etc. </P>
	  <P>There are 
		numerous glaciers in the Jotunheim but compared with those of the Alps 
		they are generally uninteresting. Even the Jostedalsbre, the largest glacier 
		in Europe, does not offer many allurements though it yields some fair 
		ice expeditions. It can be approached from various stations on the Sogne-or 
		Lysterfjord. </P>
	  <P>Besides 
		the Jotunheim there are other districts and peaks in Central Norway which 
		will interest the climber: for instance the well-known Romsdalshorn above 
		Aandalsnes. Further north is the Sunnm&ouml;re group as to which information 
		will be found in E. C. <I>Oppenheim’s New Climbs in Norway</I>. On the 
		subject of bibliography it may be mentioned that there is an excellent 
		tourist guide to Norway which gives most detailed information as to all 
		the huts and the routes over the principal passes, viz., Nils Onsager’s 
		<I>Til Fots</I>. Kr 13,50. The most useful book in English is <I>Norway: 
		The Northern Playground</I>, by W. C. Slingsby. </P>
	  <P>The new 
		Survey maps have not yet been published as to the whole of Jotunheim but 
		two useful sheets are available, viz., Topografisk Kart over Norge, Blad 
		30 B., Bygdin, and 30 D., Galdh&ouml;ppigen. Kr. 1,40. The scale of the 
		maps is 1: 100,000, they are clearly printed and are easy to read. Another 
		good map of Jotunheim, though on a smaller scale, is that of Finn Kross. 
		Kr. 3,50. In districts not covered by these maps one has to rely on the 
		old Amtskart (Fylkeskart) scale 1: 200,000. Kr. 2. Useful general maps, 
		scale 1: 400,000 can be obtained from Norway House, Trafalgar Square. 
		</P>
	  <P>A holiday 
		in Norway will not be a cheap one. The tariffs of hotels in Jotunheim 
		last summer were about the same as those prevailing for similar accommodation 
		in Switzerland. Since that time Norwegian Kroner have improved and English 
		climbers will probably find Norway a little more expensive than Switzerland. 
		English is not spoken at many of the chalet-hotels, but there is a phrase-book 
		at the end of Baedeker’s <I>Norway and Sweden</I> which will save the 
		climber from starvation, and if properly used may even provide him with 
		luxuries! L. A. E. </P>
	  <H2>Ski-ing at home </H2>
	  <P>AS most 
		people know, this winter has given plenty of opportunity for ski-ing in 
		England and Scotland. In many parts of the North ski-ing can be quite 
		good, and a few notes on possibilities may be useful to those who are 
		the proud possessors of a pair of skis, and who live within easy reach 
		of the hills. Cambridge parties skied at Dalwhinnie in the Highlands in 
		January last year and again at Christmas. Teesdale and Swaledale and the 
		Ogwen Valley have been tried, and also the main street of Malvern, and 
		the villa-lined avenues of Golders Green. </P>
	  <P>It was last 
		November that we skied in Teesdale. Langdon Beck Hotel is over twelve 
		hundred feet up, and apart from the snowy conditions the wide, open dale, 
		dotted with whitewashed farms, has a great attraction. </P>
	  <P>The valley 
		slopes, however, are too broken up by walls for long runs, but the very 
		high plateau-like moors ensure plenty of snow and severe frost. &quot;Tailing&quot; 
		behind a car went very well, and we also had the rare experience of ski-ing 
		across the Tees on the ice. In passing it may be suggested that the most 
		enjoyable way to attack Crossfell is on ski; as little as two inches of 
		snow is enough to make all the difference between a toilsome moorland 
		walk and a pleasant run, especially in a good breeze. </P>
	  <P>Those who 
		want steep hills, however, will find very few in Teesdale; the lower parts 
		of Swaledale are better, and at least one very good run has been found 
		– most limestone districts should provide similar short steep runs. Down 
		in the valleys good snow is only found in severe weather, and in almost 
		any of the dales in Yorkshire or Derbyshire there are far too many walls. 
		Further to the West in the Lakes or North Wales snow seems to be unreliable 
		unless one climbs high; in Teesdale and Weardale a car can be taken above 
		two thousand feet at several points, higher than anywhere else in England. 
		The Cheviots, too, are smooth and steep, but rather hard to reach: a summer 
		acquaintance with them, however, suggests that they again might be more 
		attractive on ski than on foot. </P>
	  <P>Christmas 
		week-end in the Central Highlands proved a success, despite a thaw on 
		the 28th. In the previous January conditions for a few days were very 
		good indeed, with over a foot of snow. Dalwhinnie on the main Highland 
		line is easily reached, and is said to be the best centre in Scotland; 
		the slopes are very open and bare, but a depth of at least six inches 
		of snow is desirable. The natives, however, regard this as a minor fall. 
		The good run west of the village gives about three-quarters of a mile, 
		with a fall of sixteen hundred feet: this may be regarded as fairly typical. 
		</P>
	  <P>Judging 
		by the figures for Braemar snow lies at twelve hundred feet for from twenty 
		to seventy days a year (for example, twenty-seven days in December last). 
		The snowfall is slightly heavier at Dalwhinnie, and in addition Braemar 
		is harder to reach from the South. </P>
	  <P>Lastly, 
		those who have once been charmed by Scotland – whether by the glories 
		of Skye and the sea-lochs in summer, or Glen Nevis at Easter – will not 
		be disappointed in the Eastern hills when they have seen them in midwinter; 
		in a cold season the short winter days could not be better spent. </P>
	  <P>Further 
		south ski-ing is, of course, occasionally possible, but more as a joke 
		than anything else; the run from Mill Hill to Hampstead was done in January, 
		and one man has even skied to work in Durham; Derbyshire, too, has been 
		tried. In a normal winter, however, the high northern Pennines will give 
		a good deal of cross-country work with easy slopes, and the Eastern Highlands 
		will provide that and good slopes as well. As a new weapon for the armoury 
		of the inveterate bog-trotter, ski may be heartily recommended; especially 
		to those who live within reach of the hills and can therefore seize the 
		opportunity afforded by a snowfall. G. M. </P>
	  <H2>Cherryhinton 
		</H2>
	  <P>GEOFFREY 
		WINTHROP YOUNG has spoken of chalk as the missing link between rock and 
		snow, and Cambridge mountaineers need go no further than Cherryhinton 
		to find chalk pits admirably suited to the exercise of their art. Excellent 
		practice in the use of the feet is presented by the short courses that 
		abound, since hardly any of the handholds can be pulled upon. An axe of 
		some sort is essential, not only for cutting steps, but also for clearing 
		away the looser chalk on the surface. The hands have to rely almost entirely 
		on push supports, and progress upwards or downwards must be made by the 
		feet. Either rubbers or plain leather shoes may be used, but rubbers are 
		much better: if nails possess any advantage, it is quite outweighed by 
		their tendency to become clogged. It is surprising what a grip rubbers 
		give on even wet or frozen chalk. </P>
	  <P>The best 
		climbs are found in the three Old Cherryhinton pits, which may be identified 
		by the two disused kilns in the most Easterly quarry, and incidentally 
		the kilns themselves provide quite amusing climbs. The only chalk climb 
		in the east quarry is given by an obvious couloir. In the central quarry 
		there are numerous climbs, including an excellent chimney; while in the 
		west quarry a Girdle Traverse, and two long chimneys, as yet unattempted. 
		More minute details would be superfluous, as the climbs have a habit of 
		disappearing overnight, and in any case climbers will probably prefer 
		to make their own routes. Lastly, those who wish to practice absieling 
		will find an ideal spot, a sixty foot wall in the east quarry, with a 
		convenient tree at the top. I. M. W. </P>
