        <H1> Notes on Tyrol </H1><HR>

	  <P>IT cannot 
		be said that Tyrol is a country which is attracting many English climbers 
		at the present time, in spite of the whole-hearted enthusiasm for the 
		country of those who have travelled there. Occasional inspections of hut 
		books on wet days during the last two summers have shown that it is extremely 
		rare to find an English entry at all I am afraid, therefore, that notes 
		on Tyrol will not be of much practical use to anybody, but at the same 
		time I think that anyone who has had particularly enjoyable climbing in 
		some district, should occasionally place his appreciation on record and 
		hand on to others whatever he may have gained in the way of useful information, 
		and I believe most strongly that there is no country in Central Europe 
		quite so well adapted as Tyrol for guideless climbing and wandering on 
		from one group to .html without ever descending to the towns. </P>
	  <P>In the first 
		place mountaineering (it would be better still to call it mountain-wandering) 
		as practised in Austria differs enormously in extent from the same sport 
		in all other countries, for it has become more truly national than the 
		most national of our own sports. It was no doubt extremely popular before 
		the war, but it is far more so now. We realised this especially on arriving 
		for the first time in Innsbruck, when, after a long and tiring hunt in 
		the rain to find beds for the night, we were offered places in the Touristen-zimmer 
		of the Goldene Sonne. By that time we would thankfully have accepted anything 
		and ascended gladly to the highest level attainable in the hotel, where 
		in one vast attic under the rafters we found fifty or sixty beds stretched 
		in neat rows, nearly all occupied. The beds were scrupulously clean and 
		quite comfortable, and by six in the morning all the occupants had quietly 
		risen and departed. Every Austrian goes to the mountains, and this leads 
		to a most extraordinary variety in the composition of the parties that 
		are to be met there. The key-note is wandering quite as much as climbing 
		and very few people stay more than a night or two in the same hut. As 
		one sits outside one of the more popular huts there is ceaseless activity. 
		Some, it is true, who have arrived to stay will be bathing, if there is 
		a stream, or lying in the sun; but there will usually be a continual arrival 
		and departure of fresh parties, and astonishment grows on the stranger 
		as he sees every party supplied with whatever type of meal it requires 
		at any time of day. Some of these parties may be family caravans, the 
		grand-parents at the head, patriarchal in appearance and deliberate in 
		gait, and the latest additions, in diminutive shorts and Gr&uuml;ss Gott 
		emblazoned braces, in the rear. The more workmanlike are, of course, those 
		made up of two or three men, but they are not by any means the only ones 
		who will be found on the peak the next morning. </P>
	  <P>It may perhaps 
		seem from this that the huts will be excessively crowded, and it is undoubtedly 
		most important for people who intend to climb in Austria to become members 
		of the D. &amp; Oe. A.V. or of the O.A.C., in order to have a right to 
		use their huts, which are usually very large and almost luxurious. The 
		bigger ones are built to hold a hundred or more people, and many are being 
		enlarged, so that it is only the most popular of all, such as the Erzherzog 
		Johann hut on the Glockner, which are consistently overflowing. No beds 
		are allotted to non-members of the dub, however early in the day they 
		may arrive, until late in the evening after the members have been satisfied. 
		Membership of the club is easily obtained. It costs ten shillings for 
		entrance and ten shillings a year. As the charges for a bed in a hut are 
		doubled, or even trebled, for non-members, this sum is more than saved 
		in the first week. It is the exception for a hut to be unprovisioned; 
		even the Brandenburger hut in the middle of the Gepatsch glacier, at a 
		height of. over 10,000 feet, can supply the most excellent meals, although 
		it is an eight hours’ journey from the road, of which a considerable part 
		is .impossible for mules. Prices are slightly less than those ruling in 
		the valleys, and, although the days of fabulous cheapness are over, the 
		cost of climbing and living in Austria, taking hotels and huts together, 
		is almost exactly half of the cost in Switzerland. The Austrians are extremely 
		pleasant in their relations with visitors, though probably few parties 
		will receive quite such a warm welcome as we did on descending from the 
		Silvretta group to Wiesberg on the main railway, where a very large and 
		slightly inebriated Austrian embraced us enthusiastically on the ground 
		that we were compatriots of Henry VIII. &quot;Heinrich der Achte,&quot; 
		he said more than once, &quot; war ein Mann ! Er hatte sechs Frauen ! 
		! &quot; </P>
	  <P>In planning 
		a tour there is one point in particular which should be noted – the crossing 
		of the Italian frontier is often impossible. In 1924 it was forbidden 
		by the Italian authorities almost entirely, which was particularly awkward 
		if one had planned to tour around the head of the Ahrenthal. In 1925 some 
		of the high huts just inside Italy, such as the Becherhaus in the Stubaier 
		Alps, could be used, provided no further descent were made into Italy, 
		and a crossing was permitted without trouble at certain other points such 
		as the Timmeljoch between the Oetzthal and Passeierthal. The descent from 
		the Oetzthal peaks into the Langtaufererthal and a return to Austria over 
		the Reschenscheideck could also be carried out without interference. Probably 
		in 1926 there will be less trouble still, for as far as one can see there 
		is no reason why any difficulty should be made at all. </P>
	  <P>Mayrhofen, 
		with a charming old hotel, the Alte Post, where all the lintels of the 
		bedroom doors are occupied at night by rows of swallows, is a centre from 
		which the climber can take his choice of several different valleys with 
		their surrounding peaks. Perhaps the pleasantest course to follow is to 
		leave the rucksacks to come up by the daily mule-post and walk the whole 
		length of the Zillerthal to the Berliner H&uuml;tte, about seven hours 
		away. This may be said to be the most luxurious of all huts, and is the 
		finest product of D. &amp; Oe. A.V. methods of hut construction and maintenance. 
		The peaks around are the best of the Zillerthal Alps. The Schwarzenstein 
		is easy and popular, being but a long snow trudge, but near at hand, though 
		only visible when one climbs up to the Schwarzsee, is a rock peak of great 
		spikiness called the Zsigmondyspitze. No English rockclimber could leave 
		without attempting it. The ordinary route leads up the S.E. ar&ecirc;te 
		and makes a long and interesting traverse right across the west face and 
		back again to avoid some difficult overhanging slabs. Above the traverse 
		the route continues on the ridge and then gains the summit by some chimneys 
		on the east face. On these faces there are routes of the most intense 
		difficulty, some of which have only been climbed once or twice, and apparently 
		involve complicated methods of swinging pendulum-like across various mauvais 
		pas. The Thurnerkamp and M&ouml;sele are both snow and ice climbs, which 
		may be taken from the Berliner hut, but the Masele may be ascended with 
		greater ease by crossing first to the Furtschagel hut over the easy Sch&ouml;nbichlerhorn. 
		From its summit there is an extensive view from the Glockner to the Bernina, 
		with all the long ranges of the Dolomites in the south. The Furtschagel 
		is a hut set on a bare rock platform on which all the heat of the sun 
		at midday seems to be focussed from the surrounding semicircle of glaciers. 
		The Hochfeiler, a peak which used to be attempted only from the western 
		side, is now sometimes climbed from this hut, but the routes are extremely 
		long – nine, ten or eleven hours, and involve the passage of a crevassed 
		glacier and the ascent of either a loose rock ar&ecirc;te or 1,800 feet 
		of a steep snow, or, later in the season ice face, a serious expedition, 
		seldom done. </P>
	  <P>It would 
		be impossible to indicate the chief attractions of all the other groups, 
		but two expeditions may be singled out in particular. The first is to 
		cross from Windisch-Matrei to Kals by the Kalser-T&ouml;rl, a very beautiful 
		grass pass where one may appreciate the Austrian spirit of wandering perhaps 
		better than anywhere else, and then climb the Glockner from Kals. The 
		first glimpse of the sharp peak of the Glockner just catching the dawn, 
		with the splintered wall of the Glocknerwand beside it like a great black-crested 
		wave about to topple over, will stir the blood of the coolest climber 
		as he turns into the K&ouml;dnitzthal from the lower valley. The second 
		expedition is to gain the Brandenburger hut in the Oetzthaler Alps, having 
		climbed the Wildspitz and whatever else calls you on the way, and then 
		set out very early across the wide Gepatsch snow fields towards the sharpest 
		cut and whitest of all snow peaks, the Weisskugel. It will be late enough 
		in the day, however early the start, before the rock wall down to the 
		Langtauferer glacier has been descended, and all the long uphill slopes 
		to the Weisskugeljoch are left behind; but if the conditions are good 
		the summit can then be reached by cutting straight up the 1,200 feet of 
		excessively steep bare wall that sweeps down right from the summit to 
		the joch, without a break of the pure white in its whole surface. Two 
		and a half hours from the joch down the Langtauferer glacier there is 
		a very small and pleasant hut, called the Weisskugel hut, and the descent 
		into this valley is a very good way of finishing a tour through Austria, 
		for the Ortler lies only a short distance away, or if one wants to get 
		into Switzerland it is equally easy to reach the Engadine and so either 
		the Silvretta or the Bernina groups. </P>
	  <P>Enthusiasts 
		write at times of some district they have just discovered as though all 
		climbers should be pressed into parties and marched off to it at once, 
		and they sometimes almost scold their fellow-men for not sharing all their 
		enthusiasms. While I am anxious not to go to this extreme, I am still 
		convinced that there must be many people who would find in Austria exactly 
		the type of climbing and wandering which would suit them, if they would 
		only strike a little further east than usual. </P>
	  <P>The literature 
		on the Group is very extensive, mostly in German. B&auml;deker’s &quot;Eastern 
		Alps &quot; is very good and the Maps are splendid. More information for 
		the climber will be found in Purtscheller &amp; Hess’ &quot;Hochtourist,&quot; 
		Vol. II., 1911 and still more details in H. Delago's &quot;Die Zillertaler 
		Alpen.&quot; </P>
