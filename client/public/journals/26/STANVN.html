		of us met Van Noorden when he came up to Clare in 1922 he was quiet and 
		only his desperate attraction towards the hills would make him talkative. 
		To know him more intimately was to appreciate his quiet; or imperturbability 
		as it would perhaps be better explained; in rain, in wind, on difficult 
		rock or on easy rock he had the same happy calm, from which only the worst 
		mountaineering betises could disturb him. Before he came up he had had 
		a very meagre season in the Dauphine and finding no one to lead him in 
		the Lakes in the following Easter vacation he constrained .html beginner 
		to invest in a rope and to tackle some of the ' moderates.' Those who 
		started their own climbing career, and they are legion, by leading their 
		own parties can remember the ecstacy of their first ascent; whatever satisfaction 
		one may have derived from later climbs one cannot recall the same complete 
		happiness of the first step along the endless road of becoming a mountaineer. 
		From this time the hills had V.N. in their exacting thrall; every vacation 
		found him wandering among them and more of his time in terms than pleased 
		his tutor was spent in reading about them and discussing any aspect of 
		Mountaineering theoretical or practical. 
	  <P>In the Summer 
		of 1923 he came to the Club Meet; after twelve days of perfect weather 
		he went southwards with L. A. Ellwood into the Cottians. Next term we 
		heard his tale; they had been marched out of Italy at the point of the 
		revolver by a gendarme who would not trust them. After three days climbing, 
		V.N. could indeed look villainous; his hair never sleek, stood on end, 
		terrifying in appearance, but to be thrown out of Italy for it was one 
		of his happiest memories. By devious routes they won across the border 
		and came upon a village whose male population was without exception drunk; 
		they were informed by their hostess as she locked them in their bedroom 
		to prevent the intrusion of revellers, that this happened regularly every 
		Saturday to Monday. 
	  <P>They returned 
		to Switzerland and climbed at Saas Fee and then at Zermatt. V.N. was left 
		at Zermatt as six weeks had left him without funds, which was the only 
		cogent reason for him to leave the hills, so that he was compelled home. 
		Unfortunately the evening before he went was fine; he had a return ticket 
		from Paris to London and by careful calculation he computed the bare amount 
		needed to land him home, literally penniless; with the remainder he found 
		he had just enough to hire a guide and buy provisions, which he did. Next 
		day he traversed the Ober Gabelhorn and caught the evening train down 
		the valley - home. 
	  <P>That Christmas 
		(1923) he was one of the instigators of a camp in Wastdale, the like of 
		which for pure jest was never equaIled; from there we went to Wales and 
		climbed until the beginning of term. In summer I924, there occurred, what 
		to him was a tragedy; having obtained a first in Part I. Natural Science, 
		he was informed by his tutor that if he wished to read Part II. Physics 
		he would have to stay up for the long vacation term; he managed however 
		to get out for the C.U.M.C. meet, but bad luck seemed to dog them. He 
		and his party got mixed up with bad weather and the French military manoeuvres 
		They managed to cross the Chasseforet in a blizzard and prove to their 
		own satisfaction that if they marched carefully on a compass they could 
		be accurate. His party hoping for better weather went South to the Dauphine, 
		but the season was impossible and they came home. 
	  <P>We went 
		to camp in Wales to finish the Vacation. The first night our tent blew 
		into Llyn Llydaw and we were forced to spend the rest of our time in the 
		Cottage just below Glaslyn; ï¿½ the roof had to be mended; coal fetched 
		over the Bwlch from Llanberis and the fire lit, which when lit put us 
		through a species of smoke curing, but amid it all he seemed in his element; 
		he lost his quaint reserve and told ghost stories or argued about the 
		more obscure theories of mountaineering. 
	  <P>Next term 
		he came up as President of the C.U.M.C. and as such he will be best remembered 
		by many of us. He made an excellent president; he knew personally nearly 
		every member of the Club who climbed. Every Sunday he held a mountaineering 
		breakfast which lasted from about 9 a.m. till mid-day and was open to 
		all who cared to come, and he would be prepared to talk &quot;climbing&quot; 
		at anytime with anybody. 
	  <P>At Easter, 
		Dr. Clark Kennedy, he and I spent a delightful holiday in Scotland; we 
		packed food up to the half-way hut on Ben Nevis and spent a cold fortnight 
		there; it was not comfortable but it was difficult even to grumble when 
		V.N. regarded it as part of the game. We did no climb, but we had three 
		attempts on the Tower ridge and on the last we made an Alpine start with 
		the dawn and spent eleven hours of the best climbing we had together. 
		
	  <P>In the Summer 
		we started in the Argentiere basin; attempted the Tour Noir in unspeakable 
		weather and were turned by a justly indignant peak; we then turned our 
		attention to the Chamonix district but without any success, except for 
		an attempt on the Aig. Verte and the Dent de Geant. Going up the Geant 
		ice-fall an incident occurred which is rather illustrative of his imperturbability. 
		
	  <P>By misfortune 
		he dropped down a crevasse his pocket book containing all his money; on 
		looking in we could see nothing, but he decided to descend; by using the 
		crevasse as a chimney for thirty feet, he landed on a snow bridge and 
		on looking over he saw his pocket book on an unstable snow patch some 
		thirty-6ve feet below. The crevasse was now too narrow for back and foot 
		work, so that by means of a rope ladder made from the spare rope, he climbed 
		down and after an hour's delay he re-appeared over the lip successful 
		and triumphant. 
	  <P>We then 
		went to Courmayeur and climbed the Aiguille Noire and from thence over 
		Mt. Blanc by the Brouillard ridge to Chamonix. 
	  <P>He conducted 
		a most successful meet at Arolla and his ability to get his reluctant 
		party off in the early morning was not the least of his attributes. 
	  <P>Dr. Clark-Kennedy, 
		Edwin Kempson, he and I crossed over to Zermatt, but the weather became 
		impossible. However, he led us up the Ober Gabelhorn only to meet with 
		snow and wind; the descent was his last piece of Alpine work and it was 
		difficult enough; the weather became worse and we decided to finish our 
		Vacation in Wales. 
	  <P>We stayed 
		some thirty miles from Snowdon and we went over every day by any means 
		of transit on which we could lay our hands. On September 2nd at 6.3o, 
		he left the farm where we were staying to try and make a girdle traverse 
		of Clogwen-y-person with H. R. C. Carr. My last recollection was V.N. 
		in his beloved climbing coat pedalling down the road to Beddgelert. 
	  <P>Many of 
		us feel the loss at the outset of our climbing career of a friend and 
		a leader.<BR>
