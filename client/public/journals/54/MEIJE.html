	  <P>WHEN I was 
		asked to go to the Alps last summer, I jumped at the offer. So it was 
		that on the 1st of June, 1953 Ted Wrangham, David Fisher, Andr&eacute; 
		Kopczsynski and myself set out in Ted�s Jaguar from London, our first 
		destination Lympne and the Silver City Airways. The flight across was 
		uneventful and after a very comfortable and pleasant run from Le Touquet, 
		I was enjoying my first sight of Paris. </P>
	  <P>Next morning, 
		after spending a short while in Pierre Allain�s shop, we proceeded southwards 
		at a leisurely 80 m.p.h., and after a further night spent in a small hotel, 
		midday found us twisting and turning up a tortuous bit of road leading 
		to �La B&eacute;rarde in the Dauphin&eacute;. This was to be our headquarters 
		for a week. Our arrival in La B&eacute;rarde aroused some interest, but 
		it waned slightly when we produced tents. Within a short while we were 
		pleasantly encamped, with a glacier fed stream within convenient distance 
		for collecting water. A short tour was then made of the town. This did 
		not take long, as it consisted of only about seven buildings, of which 
		five were hotels. Readers will understand then why our tents were not 
		appreciated, especially as they come from the depths of a &quot;Jag&quot; 
		boot. </P>
	  <P>When we 
		had bought a good stock of provisions, and agreed on the way to our first 
		climb the following morning, we returned to cook our dinner and to go 
		to bed early. It was the first time for many years that I have been disturbed 
		at such an ungodly hour, but the air was pleasant enough when we had a 
		few clothes on; within an hour we had packed everything up and were on 
		our way. </P>
	  <P>It was not 
		without a little trepidation that I set out, but the thought that later 
		on that day I should be on the top of one of those lovely peaks, which 
		were now only blacker outlines against a black darkness, was stronger 
		than any fear I might have had, though there was still immeasurable awe. 
		The first climb we had chosen was the west arete Pic Nord des Cavales. 
		It entailed a very long tramp from La B&eacute;rarde to reach the start, 
		and it was quite light by the time we had roped up, but the climb itself 
		went well enough, although I was making rather hard weather of it through 
		height, and the resulting lack of breath. The feeling on reaching the 
		top of a real mountain was as great as I had always imagined. We did not 
		stay there long, but made our way down as quickly as possible, as we had 
		been warned that it was still rainy every afternoon, and we were taking 
		no chances. This day though, we were safely back in camp when the rain 
		started around five, pretty tired, because it had been a long day and 
		our first climb, but content. After a day of rest we were off again, this 
		time with some stores, bound for the hut. Towering above and away from 
		us was the Meije, which I had seen before on our first climb, but which 
		now could be studied more leisurely. The Meije, however, did not enter 
		our heads until we had returned from our second climb, again a west arete, 
		this time of the Point des Aigles. There had been one rather perturbing 
		incident on the way up this, when a rock nearly the size of my head tried 
		to bomb me. Fortunately it richochetted off my back, and no damage was 
		done, but I spent a little while ruminating before finishing the pitch 
		I was on at the time. </P>
	  <P>Back at 
		the hut, which we reached in record time after glissading most of the 
		way, we debated our next climb. Eventually it was decided that we should 
		do the classic traverse of the Meije via the glacier Carr&eacute; from 
		the Promontoire hut. Supplies were running short, so next day we tossed 
		to see who should go back to La B&eacute;rarde to pick up fresh food and 
		to bring it right up to the Promontoire, but Ted and I were lucky, so 
		after saying au revoir to Dave and Andr&eacute; we took most of what foodstuffs 
		were left and proceeded to the Promontoire hut, which was perched a little 
		way up on the arete we had to climb the next day. </P>
	  <P>Snow was 
		down so far that the stream given in the guide proved not only waterless 
		but non-existent. After a fruitless search for .html, Ted and I as arranged, 
		went ahead to scout the route we would be following in darkness the following 
		day. When we returned we were surprised to find that Dave and Andr&eacute; 
		had already arrived, some hours ahead of schedule. During dinner, which 
		was as usual a throw-in of corned-beef, rice, onions and a tube of tomato 
		pur6e, the chief subject of conversation was the weather. It had snowed 
		on the mountains, and rained in the valleys, regularly every afternoon 
		we had been in the area, bearing out what the people had said. It had 
		never however come any earlier than three, and usually started around 
		five. If the morning was fine therefore and we could start out, it would 
		have to be early. </P>
	  <P>At 2.30 
		a.m. therefore the kettle was boiling: by three we were off, Ted and I 
		leading in the darkness the route which we had scouted the previous afternoon. 
		Gradually, as we could see better, we progressed a little faster. At about 
		9.30 we had reached the level of the glacier Carr&eacute;, and began our 
		traverse on to it. At 11 p.m. we were eating some food on top of the glacier 
		Carr&eacute; in the hollow between the twin peaks of the Meije. So far 
		we were making good enough time and, as we proceeded on our way the sky 
		started to get a little darker, but nobody worried particularly about 
		it. Suddenly, however, about two pitches from the top of the right hand 
		peak, it began to snow, gently at first, but by the time we had all reached 
		the top, it was swirling and thick. There was now no time to waste; a 
		regrouping of forces was called for. Dave, who had six Alpine seasons 
		to his credit, took the lead, next Andr&eacute; with one season, myself 
		in my first, and Ted bringing up the rear, the second most experienced 
		of the party on his third. A detailed description of the traverse, done 
		in ever worsening conditions, with occasional stops to discard humming 
		ice axes, is impossible; the main thought in all our minds was to keep 
		moving as fast as possible, not to mind the snow melting and penetrating 
		everything, only to keep moving, keep warm. When we had reached the next 
		peak our traverse was complete; Dave had done his job safely and well. 
		Now all we had to do was to get onto thc snow and walk off the mountain 
		to the nearest hut, which was, according to the guide book, not very far 
		away. Besides the snow had stopped, but our troubles were by no means 
		at an end. It was getting dark. We began to make our way down. Combined 
		with the gathering darkness a mist, which still lingered, prevented our 
		seeing more than about 50 feet ahead. Ted, who was leading, now came to 
		a series of bergschrunds. We were getting nowhere fast. &quot;I�m going 
		to jump it,&quot; from Ted. Silence and tenseness from us in reply. A 
		jump � safe � jubilation on our parts. Three more bergschrunds followed 
		the first, then &quot;Well, boys, here�s where we sleep the night: cosy, 
		eh?&quot; </P>
	  <P>An hour 
		later, by the light of a flickering candle four people, feet in rucksacks, 
		could be seen eating a little food. The mist had cleared, and the sky 
		was perfectly clear. &quot;No more snow anyway, and thank heavens not 
		too much wind.&quot; � &quot;Are you cold?&quot; &quot;A little.&quot; 
		&quot;Midnight,&quot; one, two o�clock: pass round the sugar, figs, apricots, 
		raisins, anything to keep my mind off the cold. Wish I hadn�t only worn 
		a light shirt and cotton vest under my anorak and that they hadn�t got 
		wet, but just think, 90�F at home in the shade. Three o�clock, let�s have 
		a bit of chocolate, wish my teeth wouldn�t chatter. Four o�clock, &quot;Come 
		along, fellows, let�s start making a move. It�ll soon be light.&quot; 
		&quot;O.K.&quot; &quot;Brother, I�m stiff, me too, boots frozen up, can�t 
		get mine on, ah there it is.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Start slowly 
		down. Just a few feet away a place where we could easily have crossed 
		the bergschrund. Still, glad we didn�t risk pressing on, no telling what 
		might have happened. Sky suddenly seems to get lighter. Look, Mt. Blanc. 
		</P>
	  <P>Away in 
		the distance, poking its way through a layer of lowish lying cloud, was 
		indeed Mt. Blanc. There was no mistaking her. One side was covered with 
		that glorious pink of dawn on snow, which is only matched in colour by 
		the glory of a queen conchshell; the other side still lay in darkness 
		seemingly expectant, waiting to take on life again after the colourlessness 
		of night. It is one of those views which I shall always think of with 
		pleasure, tinged with a little awe, but it cheered us up tremendously, 
		and a sight of the hut not more than half an hour�s walk away made our 
		hearts light. When we reached it it looked as if nobody had been in it 
		for months. Nobody had, we learnt later. Andr&eacute; and I decided come 
		what may we were going to have some sleep before we proceeded down to 
		La Grave. Dave and Ted went on straight away. I didn�t sleep for long, 
		and went. and sat in the sun until Andr&eacute; woke up. We left the hut 
		eventually around 1 p.m., following the other�s footsteps. It was nice 
		to be down below the snow line once again, to hear the tinkle of the sheep 
		bells and the tonkle of the cow bells; One thing about a night in the 
		snow, I thought: it certainly makes you appreciate those things you�re 
		apt to take too much for granted. </P>
	  <P>Le Grave 
		showed some interest in us. Where had we come from? Who were we? What 
		had we done? Our answers set off a hubbub of conversation. Evidently we 
		couldn�t have been &quot;Anglaise&quot; and traversed the Meije, because 
		the last two Anglaise who had tried it had been found frozen stiff in 
		a bergschrund next day. Hunger called, however, and we searched out an 
		hotel. It was gone 3 p.m., and they stopped serving lunch at 3 p.m., but 
		everybody was kind, and with a lovely meal before us, our first proper 
		meal for many hours, and a large bottle of wine each, we couldn�t have 
		asked for more. </P>
	  <P>We booked 
		rooms in the hotel for the night, and went in search of Ted and Dave. 
		While we were all walking back to the hotel we were approached by a youngish 
		chap who wanted to hear all about it over again. He had done the last 
		traverse of the season last year, and had hoped to do the first this year, 
		but did not think the weather was steady enough yet. We were very lucky. 
		You mean � yes, ours was the first traverse of the season � our triumph 
		was complete. </P>
