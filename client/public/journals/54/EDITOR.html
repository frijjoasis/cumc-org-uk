		<H1>NOTES BY THE EDITOR</H1>
	  </DIV>
	  
	  <P>THE Editor 
		feels bound to apologise to those contributors who, whenever he met them, 
		were asked: &quot;When will that article be ready?&quot; Thanks to their 
		efforts to satisfy him there is quite a varied bill of fare at last, in 
		which it is hoped that the doings of the Tigers are fairly balanced with 
		those of the Rabbits – as one of our speakers aptly described them – in 
		other words, of the simple majority of climbers, The Editor would like 
		to thank all those who contributed or advised, but especially the Journal 
		Treasurer, who frequently alarmed the Editor in revealing and correcting 
		Editorial blunders, and whose zeal for advertising and general efficiency 
		deserve high praise. </P>
	  <P>Speaking 
		of Everest, we will simply emphasise those congratulations which were 
		telegraphed to Katmandu on Coronation Day. We are proud of what members 
		of the Club have done in the past, and in the last successful expedition, 
		to make the final triumph possible. </P>
	  <P>We much 
		regret to record the death last year of W. R. B. Battle, of Fitzwilliam 
		House, and an associate member. </P>
	  <P>Very sincere 
		thanks to Mr. W. N. Coombes for a gift of books to, the Wherry Library, 
		now in new quarters in St. John’s: we am also very grateful to the authorities 
		of that College for allowing us the use of a room. </P>
	  <P>We would 
		also like to thank members of the Senior Committee: Mr. A. M. Binnie for 
		his services as Senior Treasurer, and Alfred Tissi&egrave;res for so kindly 
		allowing us to use his room in King’s for the coffee parties held after 
		meetings: an innovation begun this year, for which we are also indebted 
		to the College authorities, since they allow mobs of mountaineers to enter 
		after 10 p.m. </P>
	  <P>At the Annual 
		General Meeting last June it was proposed to raise the subscription to 
		one pound, that a Journal might be published this year. At an Extraordinary 
		General Meeting in the Michaelmas Term this was approved, and the Journal 
		Committee were duly grateful for being given employment. </P>
	  <P>The activities 
		of the Club, practical, literary and armchair have continued with their 
		wonted vigour. We again decided not to print accounts of meets, which 
		last year were held at Langdale, Nevis, in Skye and in Ogwen, but not, 
		alas, in the Alps. &quot;The usual climbs were done...,&quot; The Helyg-Glandena 
		meet last December was notable for the beautiful spring-like weather, 
		which encouraged new ascents on distant ranges and profitable excursions 
		by moon light; The Helyg dinner on the second week was usually stew from 
		some peculiarly intractible meat, and frozen sausages. Last term equally 
		incredible weather gave us Arctic conditions and horizontal ice experience. 
		Proposals to make artificial pitches of vertical ice for practice proved 
		impossible to carry out. During term Gritstone meets have continued, and 
		on Sundays certain people absent themselves to Charnwood, Harrison’s and 
		elsewhere with monotonous regularity. We are deeply indebted to the Climbers’ 
		Club, the Wayfarers, the Scottish Mountaineering Club and the Midland 
		Association of Mountaineers, who have so kindly lent us their huts, and 
		thus given us such enjoyable meets. </P>
	  <P>Mr. R. E. 
		Maxim, A.R.P.S., again very kindly consented to judge the Photographic 
		competition in the Lent Term. He awarded the 1st and 2nd prizes to G. 
		C. Kunzle (Christ’s) and consolation prizes to G. J. Fraser (King’s), 
		J. C. H. Davis (Peterhouse), E. D. G. Langmuir (Peterhouse) and J. P. 
		Gaukroger (Clare). Mr. Maxim emphasised that it was most important for 
		mountain photographers to develop their own films, as over-development 
		is so fatal to good rendering of snow and sky. The reason for the small 
		number of photographs in this Journal is the Need for Economy at present. 
		The Annual Dinner was held at the University Arms on May 9th, 1953, and 
		again we saw Companions on the Rope elegantly dressed, plying the knife 
		and fork with the usual gusto but unusual finesse. Speeches were made, 
		and plans for the future discussed, on which note we may conclude. Guests 
		were: J. H. Emlyn Jones, Alpine Club. Anthony Rawlinson, Climbers’ Club. 
		Neil Mather, Rucksack Club. Alan Blackshaw, O.U.M.C. </P>
