	  <P>IT has been 
		common in the past to date mountaineering in its modern sporting form 
		from Sir Alfred Wills’ ascent of the Hasle Jungfrau peak of the Wetterhorn 
		in 1854, this despite the fact that it was long since proved to be at 
		least the fourth ascent. (Ten years before the Rosenlaui route had twice 
		been successfully followed and it had been used again by the Englishman, 
		Blackwell, three months before Wills’ Grindelwald ascent. Blackwell had 
		followed the latter route also, but was stopped by storm below the final 
		cornice). Wills cannot, I regret, claim very great singularity for his 
		climb; Blackwell for one has an equal claim to fame as having launched 
		the new movement – but there are others such as the Rev. Wm. Hudson who 
		were already at work. In March 1853 Hudson made several attempts on the 
		Aiguille du Gouter. </P>
	  <P>If, however, 
		no climb of the early fifties can rightly be said to have marked a complete 
		break with the past and to have initiated the "Golden Age," there is a 
		document which offers a fine and’ natural boundary separating the Golden 
		Age and modern mountaineering from the century of gradual awakening which 
		came first. This is a book which, though concerned with Mont Blanc (the 
		focus of attention during the preceding period), treats that mountain 
		in a revolutionary manner. It comes indeed from one associated above all 
		with the new school – of climbing for fun and fun alone. </P>
	  <P>The book 
		to which I refer is called "The Story of Mont Blanc." Published in 1853, 
		it is in effect the Birth Certificate of the sport of Alpine Climbing. 
		The author was Albert Smith, a man more usually remembered for the £30,000 
		he is said to have made by lecturing on Mont Blanc in the Egyptian Hall, 
		PiccadilIy. As I have said, Smith has a place in the modern period, and 
		not only is this for that phenomenal success as a populariser of the Alps, 
		but also for his original membership of the Alpine Club. Unlike so many 
		of his predecessors, he was neither soldier, scientist nor priest. His 
		writing shows a feeling for mountains very much like ours today. The date 
		of his book falls, very happily, in the middle of the transition period 
		between the "Age of Mont Blanc" and the modern age, between the ages of 
		his own climb and those of his contemporaries. (The latter age began with 
		a surge of activity on the part of several independent climbers, mostly 
		Englishmen, but though these strands converged, with the formation of 
		the Alpine Club in 1857, they had not a single common origin). The book 
		itself is now seen to be in fact an almost complete post mortem on the 
		incubation period of Alpine Climbing: it is largely a history of the preceding 
		century’s activity on Mont Blanc and the final chapters describe the author’s 
		ascent in 1851 – one of the last in the old style yet done by a member 
		of the new school. </P>
	  <P>Let us then 
		take this book as our birth certificate, and, if you will, as the obituary 
		of our parent. Then do we discover the supremely happy coincidence of 
		the centenary of its publication with the appearance of "The Ascent of 
		Everest." An even more strangely parallel subject can be found in Murray’s 
		"Story of Everest" under the same ’53 date, but the really surprising 
		fact is that the first popular monograph of the highest peak of the Alps 
		should precede by exactly a century, the first complete monograph on the 
		highest peak of all. </P>
	  <P>As to the 
		actual climbs of Hunt and Smith, there is a superficial dissimilarity 
		between the first in 1953 and the thirty-seventh (twentieth British!) 
		ascent in 1851. Nevertheless in several other respects there are remarkable 
		similarities between the two and comparison is rewarding. Particularly 
		striking is the size of the expeditions and their equipment. The twenty 
		guides and about twenty porters that were taken in 1853 are distinctly 
		reminiscent of the Everest porterage. (One ventures to suspect that in 
		2053 the paraphernalia of Everest today will seem no less incredible). 
		Then we may contrast the artist and illustrator, Wm. Beverley, who accompanied 
		Smith to Chamonix, and the numerous cameras taken to Everest. The Times 
		was notified on the earlier occasion by letter from Smith, but the ethical 
		issue which brought most correspondence and criticism was the risking 
		of the lives of guides, not the case for oxygen. Smith had no film but 
		did have some skilfully lit moving scenery compiled from drawings with 
		which to illustrate his lectures! One such lecture was delivered at a 
		Command Performance at Osborne on August 24th, 1854, and there is yet 
		.html significant link with last year’s expedition, which was similarly 
		honoured. </P>
	  <P>It is indeed 
		true that the record success of the books, films and lectures of Everest 
		are closely following the equally unprecedented success of the book, handbooks 
		of drawings and the lectures which followed Smith’s expedition. Perhaps 
		we can find part of the reason for the similarities in the two mountains 
		themselves. Both are famed not only for supreme height, but for supreme 
		grandeur and each has presented certain difficulties which were yet not 
		extreme. They are both by way of being noble patriarchs rather than slender, 
		ravishing maidens. Neither is a Matterhorn or Muztagh Tower. </P>
	  <P>One must 
		conclude this comparison by recalling the influence of the book and lectures 
		of Smith – an influence probably greater than that of Wills’ " Wanderings 
		among the High Alps" (more reason for putting Smith first on any list). 
		One wonders for the future..... Are we to see an equal change in orientation, 
		an equal expansion in the next century. What will be in Cambridge Mountaineering 
		in 2053 in place of the Pillars of Fresnay? </P>
	  <P>I shall 
		not attempt to precis the "Story of Mont Blanc "; I hope rather that you 
		will read it as a fascinating historical document. The story is simply 
		and amusingly recounted and remains eminently readable; the illustrations 
		are pleasing, especially the coloured frontispiece, showing De Saussure 
		on his ascent in 1787. </P>
	  <P>Fuller information 
		on Albert Smith can be found in the D.N.B. and the several histories of 
		mountaineering, but as this article would not be complete without some 
		account of the man whose importance is being urged, I offer the following 
		notes to those who cannot consult the better biographies. </P>
	  <P>Albert Richard 
		Smith was born in 1816 at Chertsey, Surrey, where his father was in practice 
		as a doctor and where he spent his early years. At a tender age he felt 
		his vocation as a showman, and he tells us in his book how his imagination 
		was fired by accounts of ascents of Mont Blanc. He would enact scenes 
		from them for the benefit of his sister who "became quite pale with fright." 
		Despite these inclinations he was compelled to learn a regular profession 
		before indulging them. After five years at the Merchant Taylor’s School 
		he was entered as a Medical Student and studied first at the Middlesex 
		Hospital and later in Paris. </P>
	  <P>It was during 
		those student days in Paris that the first of many trips to Chamonix was 
		made. In the Introduction to " the Story " he tells how he made an adventurous 
		journey through the Alps and Northern Italy with just one friend, a few 
		pounds and a haversack. They were practically hitch-hiking, travelling 
		on the cheapest coaches and on foot, and sleeping in barns in the modern 
		manner. The railway to Geneva did not yet exist. At Chamonix the young 
		Albert sought employment as a porter on the ascent of Mont Blanc, but 
		nobody was anxious to make an ascent during their stay, though only the 
		day after they departed, a woman came forward and made the second ascent 
		by a lady. The same year as this first trip to Chamonix, Albert Smith 
		sat for his medical degrees and joined his father in practice at Chertsey. 
		It was during the succeeding months in ’39 and ’40 while practising as 
		a doctor in Surrey that "Mont Blanc in a Box" was devised. He now had 
		his own experiences to supplement the narratives of such men as Auldjo, 
		and with his brother’s help he produced an illustrated lecture. It was 
		first given at the local literary and scientific institution, which had 
		recently been established, and was then taken round to similar places 
		in the Home Counties whenever there was a demand. "It was considered quite 
		a hit in the town," for his audience "had seen incandescent charcoal burnt 
		in bottles of oxygen and heard the physiology of the eye explained by 
		diagrams until any novelty was sure to succeed." He had copied his pictures 
		on a large and bold scale and contrived a simple mechanism to make them 
		roll on. He recollects in his book the particular applause which was given 
		to the moon on the Grands Mulets – behind which his brother Arthur held 
		a candle! </P>
	  <P>Besides 
		this "Mont Blanc in a Box" show, Smith was writing at this time. He had 
		published some humorous articles in the Lancet while still a medical student, 
		and now gradually extended his writing until he was able to pay his way 
		as a writer of light literature and to abandon medicine. </P>
	  <P>A trip to 
		Constantinople in the late ’40’s gave rise to two books and, in 1859, 
		to his first important public appearance. It was in an entertainment called 
		"The Overland Mail." Perhaps the success of this was partly responsible 
		for Smith’s return to Chamonix the following year with the determination 
		to climb Mont Blanc. At any rate, back he did go, though with fewer adventures 
		than in 1838: by this time the railway had been extended to Geneva and 
		only two days were required for the journey from London. </P>
	  <P>Read his 
		most entertaining account of the ascent. Despite exaggerated expressions 
		of horror and danger it shows a fine appreciation of the joys and beauty 
		of the mountains. The rather colloquial writing is interesting for its 
		greater similarity to present day English than that of many of his more 
		cultured contemporaries. Their style seems decidedly ponderous today. 
		</P>
	  <P>Incredible 
		as it may seem, the party actually took 95 bottles of wine and 46 fowls 
		as part of the supplies for the two day climb; but then, there were the 
		20 guides! The first day they reached the rocks of the Grands Mulets, 
		and there they all bivouacked. Great amusement was had after supper from 
		the rather doubtful sport of rolling empty bottles down the glacier below 
		them. Then, before midnight, they set off again in the moonlight, and 
		nearly nine hours later, at half past eight, they reached the summit. 
		Smith had certainly found the ascent arduous and describes how the moment 
		they reached the top he fell asleep! After a few minutes one of the guides 
		awoke him, so that he was able to appreciate the fine view before they 
		started on the descent within the hour. The descent seems to have been 
		more dangerous on account of melting snow, but eventually everyone got 
		back safely to the Mer de Glace and in the evening a triumphal return 
		to Chamonix was made with the conquering Englishmen mounted on mules. 
		</P>
	  <P>Celebrations 
		were loud and long and were one cause of annoyance to the eclectics, who 
		criticised the ascent in no friendly fashion. Nevertheless the public 
		liked it and flocked to the lectures for several years. If no one wrote 
		an ode to commemorate the event, we can at least find Tully’s Mont Blanc 
		Quadrille and a Polka, "Les Echos de Mont Blanc" among the "New Dance 
		Music for 1853." Both were dedicated to Alfred Smith, Esq. No echoes from 
		Everest here? </P>
	  <P>Smith lectured 
		at the Egyptian Hall for several years, frequently returning to Chamonix 
		to renew his impressions and to be f&ecirc;ted by the local people. Another 
		series of lectures were the result of a trip to China – and these began 
		in 1858. The following year he married an ex-actress, but the pair was 
		not to be blessed with a long married life. In May 1860 Smith was suddenly 
		taken ill with bronchitis, and died only four days after giving a last 
		lecture, on the eve of his forty-fifth year.</P>
