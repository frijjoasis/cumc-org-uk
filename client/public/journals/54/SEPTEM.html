	  <P>THE necessity 
		for keeping the Long Vac. Term had despatched the last of my hopes for 
		an Alpine holiday. Moreover, a broken toe and various activities at Marlow 
		and Henley had separated the members of a proposed trip to the Lofotens. 
		I determined to have a long climbing holiday in this country instead. 
		So it was that on a wet Sunday morning early in September my rather dangerously 
		overladen Royal Enfield carried Arthur Muirhead and myself north along 
		Loch Lomondside to Glencoe. I had already had three weeks in Wales and 
		Cumberland and my appetite for Scottish climbing had been whetted by a 
		visit to the Cobbler two days before. The long approach over the Rannoch 
		moor seemed dull and gave little indication of the perfect week ahead; 
		as we ran down to Kingshouse the flanks of the Buachaille Etive Mor lay 
		back, dull and uninviting, the summit hidden in thick mist. The road dipped 
		into the Glen and quickly we found ourselves at the Clachaig turning. 
		Of Eric Langmuir there was no sign. It was two o’clock. </P>
	  <P>Thinking 
		that we might find Eric at Lagangarbh, we unloaded the bike and drove 
		back up the glen; above us the cliffs of Aonach Dubh hung menacingly, 
		water streaming down them. Still the third member failed to appear, and 
		Arthur suggested a look at Crowberry Ridge. The rain had ceased for the 
		latter half of our journey and we were quite dry, but now as we climbed 
		up into the mist it became cold and wet. The step from Abraham’s Ledge 
		refused to yield and we detoured via Greig’s Ledge to the top of Stob 
		Dearg. Nearing the summit the dull wet rock seemed to take on a bluish 
		tinge as patchily the mist shredded in the wind, letting through an eerie 
		half-light. It was my second Munro and as we descended, uncomfortably 
		damp, I felt that this introduction to the Buchaille was not very propitious. 
		However, there was Eric waiting with a hot meal and life immediately took 
		on a brighter aspect. </P>
	  <P>The morning, 
		bright and clear, presented two problems. What to climb and how to get 
		there. The Buachaille provided the first answer and a spare pillion seat 
		on .html motorcycle answered the second question. We departed rather 
		noisily, finding the crisp morning air combined with the serpentine wriggles 
		of the new road quite exhilarating. The choice fell on the Central Buttress 
		and leaving the bikes a mile or so down the Etive road, we cut straight 
		across the moor and quickly up the lower slopes to the foot of a series 
		of short walls. Eric led off and soon we found ourselves ensconced on 
		a commodious and sunny ledge. We paused for oranges and chocolate. </P>
	  <P>From the 
		Heather Ledge the North Face Route offers two alternative traverses right. 
		Eric, now stripped to the waist in the broiling sun, chose the higher 
		of the traverses and slowly edged his way out and round a corner. The 
		situation was spectacular and obviously merited a photograph. Arthur followed, 
		and in due course I joined him across a wall at the foot of a rather wet 
		and rotten looking chimney with Eric already a few feet up. We found that 
		with careful handling the rock was sufficiently safe. From the top of 
		the chimney a traverse on small but adequate sloping holds led from a 
		belay out onto an airy ridge providing a delightful final pitch of eighty 
		feet over perfect warm rock. It was barely two o’clock, so with the sun 
		beating on our heads we scrambled down the Curved Ridge. I reflected that 
		my previous feelings toward the Buachaille had been unduly harsh. </P>
	  <P>Across Easy 
		Gully the Rannoch Wall stood warm and inviting; sharp lines of shadow 
		against the rock glare outlined every feature, making the three hundred 
		and fifty feet seem even more vertical. We sat and gazed – Agag’s was 
		a natural choice. I thought Arthur would lead, and was surprised when 
		Eric thrust the front end of the rope into my hands and observed to Arthur, 
		&quot;John had better lead this, it will make a good introduction to the 
		wall.&quot; Arthur had told me often of the charms and &quot;colossal 
		exposure&quot; of Agag’s Groove; also, recent experience had increased 
		my respect for Scottish grading of climbs. </P>
	  <P>I found 
		myself embarked on the first pitch and remembered the photograph of the 
		route in W. H. Murray’s &quot;Mountaineering in Scotland.&quot; A pronounced 
		groove with good holds for ninety feet almost straight up, then, curving 
		slightly left across the wall, arrived at a belay. The scree in the Gully 
		dropped quickly below and unnecessarily I split the first pitch in two. 
		Across the moor Kingshouse Inn shone white in the sun. The angle of the 
		groove eased and the line moved convexly leftward and up over red rock 
		for a full run out until a squeeze behind a large block brought me to 
		a small platform. The others arrived quickly – too quickly, for I enjoyed 
		my position and the next pitch held the crux. The groove continued at 
		the same angle for some fifteen feet, then suddenly and awkwardly, it 
		steepened. A scratched hold indicated a line out to the left and the effect 
		of forsaking the subtle shelter of the groove for the open face was quite 
		startling. In spite of the feeling that this was no place to loiter, it 
		was impossible not to resist a glance between my boots at the foot of 
		the wall. I put on a runner and after inspection found that convenient 
		foot holds, a jam and a pull brought me over the nose. More easily I reached 
		a belay. The sun was off the wall now and the triangular shadow of the 
		mountain was already creeping across the moor to Cupal Bridge. Arthur 
		appeared and I went on, sometimes back in the groove and sometimes on 
		the face, for a further seventy feet to the top of the wall and an abrupt 
		landing on the broad crest of Crowberry Ridge. The others arrived, Eric 
		almost &quot;butterflying&quot; up the wall, and we munched chocolate. 
		A feeling of singular satisfaction, obviously shared by the others, spread 
		through me. I liked this mountain. </P>
	  <P>It was cool 
		in the shadow on the ridge, and it was not long before we were traversing 
		the base of the Crowberry Tower and then down the gully and out, racing 
		across the heather in the sun till we dropped exhausted by the road; but 
		not for long: a vicious swarm of midges descended and sent us helter-skelter 
		as fast as the bumpy surface and my springs permitted. We returned to 
		the Glen, to food, and two days of doubtful weather. </P>
	  <P>Thursday 
		morning was beautiful though, and again we fixed on Rannoch Wall; Eric 
		wanted to look at January Jigsaw. We had found a ready solution to the 
		transport problem with the discovery that the Enfield was quite capable 
		of carrying three up and even maintaining a steady fifty for most of the 
		way up the Glen. Later we were to try it with four up, but found that 
		this somewhat diminished the speed. </P>
	  <P>Standing 
		at the foot of the cliff, we looked up. We had noticed before that the 
		Curved Ridge offered an excellent view- point from which to watch parties 
		on the wall, so I scrambled up with my camera while Eric and Arthur climbed 
		the first pitch of the Jigsaw. Whereas Agag’s Groove starts well to the 
		right and trends left to a finish above the centre of the wall, January 
		Jigsaw begins more to the left and then meanders over most of the right- 
		hand half of the cliff, crossing Agag’s about halfway up and then finishing 
		directly above the start. Certainly it cannot be called a direct route, 
		but it loses nothing in value by that. The first pitch, on perfect rock, 
		consisted of a short steep crack followed by a long slanting staircase, 
		climbed via a series of short walls And right angle corners. With the 
		first two at the belay the nylon swished down and I duly crossed the Gully 
		and tied on, then, as I joined Arthur, Eric traversed horizontally right 
		to a flake and belayed himself. From there the route lay round a narrow 
		nose into a shallow groove leading straight up. With Arthur now below 
		him, Eric half disappeared round the nose and as he began to inch up the 
		groove, that half of his profile still remaining in view called for .html 
		picture; I blessed the compactness of my camera. </P>
	  <P>Overhead, 
		and about a hundred and fifty feet, I could see a fantastically foreshortened 
		view of .html climber engaged on the crux of Agag’s. He must have been 
		almost directly above me, for only when he lent over could I see any part 
		of him but the soles of his boots! Suddenly a startled exclamation from 
		nearer at hand announced that Eric had discovered afresh that even large 
		blocks are not quite as secure as they look; but the rope continued to 
		creep out and all seemed well. Arthur and I climbed up, both finding the 
		first moves awkward and both avoiding the loose block until after ascending 
		left again we arrived in turn at a stance only to find ourselves sitting 
		once more in Agag’s Groove, just below the crux. </P>
	  <P>Living up 
		to its name our route now traversed right, out of the groove and round 
		a corner into the Haven. This traverse provided quite delicate footwork, 
		particularly one very pleasing move, just in balance, between two widely 
		spaced holds. When eventually it was my turn to rest in the Haven I found 
		myself in a triangular corner floored with bilberries and fitted with 
		a comforting high belay; apart from this there was nothing. Nothing on 
		either side and nothing straight down, not for two hundred feet anyway. 
		But looking out from my eyrie I could see the Moor of Rannoch stretching 
		for mile upon mile beyond Kingshouse until in the distance Loch Lomond 
		lay glinting in the sun and then, still further beyond, the cone of Schiehallion 
		rising dimly above the heat haze. Unfortunately, at this time of year 
		the sun goes early behind the mountain and I was not sorry when a signal 
		from Arthur set me climbing a short steep groove above. Forty feet brought 
		me to the next &quot;stance,&quot; though it barely justified its title: 
		a small sloping ledge with what must surely have been the grandfather 
		of all pitons protruding from a crack. Eric had already led the final 
		pitch and as I clipped onto the iron-ware Arthur prepared to move on. 
		Above hung a wicked looking crack – the crux of Satan’s Slit, and looking 
		at it I was mightily relieved when Arthur avoided it, stepping right and 
		then up. He moved out of sight. </P>
	  <P>Once more 
		by myself I wished that we had made an earlier start; a teen breeze made 
		it colder and colder and the rope crept out extraordinarily slowly. I 
		supposed it must be a lot harder than anything before: I was to find out. 
		At last a shout from the top and untying, I followed Arthur’s step right 
		and then moved up. Almost immediately I stepped down and moved left and 
		back in the relative security of the stance. I looked down into the Gully 
		and checked my Tarbuck. At the second try it went alright and the line 
		went on moving slightly one way or .html &quot;avoiding difficulties&quot; 
		but for the most part vertically straight up. What difficulties it did 
		not avoid were disconcertingly continuous and I felt rather harrowed and 
		not a little relieved when after eighty feet I was able to congratulate 
		Eric on his lead. We climbed the Crowberry Tower and ambled to the sunshine 
		at the top of the Buachaille. </P>
	  <P>The weather 
		in Glencoe seemed to have its moods and the next day being rather wet, 
		we contrived to get wetter by exploring the first five hundred feet of 
		Clachaig Gully. On Saturday we were reinforced by Guy Howard and with 
		the sky once more brilliant and clear, inevitably we found ourselves on 
		the Buachaille Etive Mor, again contemplating Rannoch Wall. The general 
		feeling was that we ought to complete the job and do the last of the three 
		easiest routes on the cliff, so with two ropes we tackled Route l. Guy 
		and Eric on one rope were soon up the first chimney. Arthur led the second 
		rope and I joined him to lead through on the second pitch, where patches 
		of rotten rock lent further interest to the technical difficulties. This 
		was a factor which up to then we had not encountered on the Wall. However, 
		it was impossible to avoid most of the loose stuff and with Arthur not 
		immediately underneath, Easy Gully was an obvious receptacle for debris. 
		On the next pitch, the first rope was delayed at .the crux; we were moving 
		too close together, so that after an ascending traverse and then a straightforward’ 
		thirty feet, I had perforce to wait at an inter- mediate belay. Eric’s 
		stance would not accommodate two. Eventually the way was clear, and Arthur 
		came up and climbed on; I joined him at a sloping stance, again with a 
		rusty peg. From here a fifteen foot wall offered one way, but a series 
		of three widely separated ledges suggested a more promising route. Another 
		of Bill Murray’s photographs came to mind. Unfortunately it was impossible 
		to see what lay round and beyond the nose above the third ledge. The three 
		ledges formed a steep traverse left that proved harder than it had looked 
		at first sight. Placing a runner on a knob I stepped up above the last 
		ledge. </P>
	  <P>The next 
		move was obvious: with the right hand on the knob, all that was required 
		was to lean out across the nose and stretch a foot across to a well marked 
		hold. But between a hundred and two hundred feet below, the boulders appeared 
		very small and I retired to look at the fifteen foot wall. This offered 
		such little consolation that I was soon back at the nose. One leg was 
		tiring rather, and I began to wonder: the runner on the knob made the 
		hand-hold uncomfortably small, yet with the runner off.... ? Perhaps Arthur 
		would like to try? He tried, and slowly made the awkward move, then stepping 
		up he quite deliberately bent his head and spat between his feet. It hit 
		the wall a few feet above the gully floor, and Arthur climbed on to the 
		belay. Once over the crux, but with a rope above me, I cursed my lack 
		of determination; it was my turn again to congratulate the leader. Firmer 
		rock lent confidence and I led the last pitch, but little remains to memory. 
		The other two had waited for us, and joining them we went up for the last 
		time to the top of the mountain. </P>
	  <P>The rain 
		of the previous day had cleared the air so that now, as distance gave 
		upon distance we could see even the Cairngorms, lying shadowy on the horizon. 
		Loch Leven shone at the feet of the mountains of Ardgour standing dark 
		against the sun. Goat Fell on Arran, the Paps of Jura, mountain beyond 
		mountain, and the two Scots seemed able to put a name to each. It was 
		unbelievable that seven days before I had never set eyes on the Buachaille, 
		yet now, after our climbs on the Crowberry Ridge, Central Buttress and 
		above all on the Rannoch Wall, I felt that this week-old acquaintance 
		had developed beyond measure. We sat content, gazing north to Nevis basking 
		above the Mamores and then, far beyond these, the jagged peaks of the 
		Cuillin beckoned – a misty blue in the setting sun. A day or so later 
		we left Glencoe and turned north to Skye. </P>
