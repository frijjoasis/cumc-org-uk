	  <P>LAST summer, 
		in a mood of revulsion, a friend and I agreed that we would write no more 
		accounts of climbs for publication. Having moral obligations to certain 
		extortionate editors we were unable to resolve against mountain articles 
		what- ever, a circumstance of which I was secretly rather glad because 
		to me writing is at least as great a pleasure as climbing. But the articles 
		must be free from all taint of self, or at least from any possibility 
		of construction as advertisement. Now a well-known lady climber had once 
		said to me: &quot;What amuses me is that none of you ever climb for pleasure.&quot; 
		The inferences of this statement were obvious enough, and they caused 
		me a good deal of worry. So our mutual ’resolution gave me a good excuse 
		for puzzling them out on paper, and the result was an article called &quot;On 
		Climbing for Pleasure.&quot; I showed it to a friend, and he informed 
		me, what I already knew, that it was trash. It ended in the waste paper 
		basket, and I was left unsatisfied: it had been a didactic piece of work, 
		and didacticism is always a bore. But the Editor’s brow drew down at my 
		lack of productivity, and as he is much bigger than I am, I was galvanised 
		into renewed action. Moreover I was convinced of the value of what I wanted 
		to say. I decided that I had been too abstract to interest, and that terms 
		of every-day experience must be found. Inevitably, inexorably, I was led 
		back, ring-in-the-nose, to writing accounts of climbs. This for explanation, 
		prologue and apology: one must express oneself as one can, and this is 
		a pamphlet. I hope you will see what I mean. </P>
	  <P>They were 
		carrying in the hay from the tilted pastures as we four walked up in evening 
		sunlight from G&ouml;schenen to the Salbih&uuml;tte. We had arrived, refugees 
		in a bad season from Chamonix, and a cold coming had of it. But a day 
		of sunny rumination, chocolate-cheered, had thawed our souls: and now, 
		as I tell you, we struck off the road and followed a remarkably steep 
		path! through a pine wood to the upper alps. We came to a chalet after 
		a time, standing in a clearing and entirely surrounded by deep mud, where 
		we bought milk from the family of the &quot;delightful old gentleman who 
		spoke no known language but was perfectly comprehensible.&quot; David, 
		who hates milk, was compelled to share a tap with the cows. Presently 
		we came to the hut, which was deserted, and we were enchanted as anyone 
		would be, for it is a perfect little place. We spent an unclouded evening 
		and a dreamless night, for we had no doubts about the climb. We wanted 
		to do the South ridge of the Salbytschin, and though we knew and hoped 
		it would give us a modicum of technical interest we were sure of our power 
		to take it in our stride. We were all friends and knew each other on the 
		mountain. We were in training. It only wanted a fine day to give us a 
		climb of unalloyed pleasure. </P>
	  <P>We got one. 
		Rising at a gentlemanly hour when it was already light, we strolled across 
		some tiresome scree to the foot of the ridge. A snow gully gave access 
		to a system of chimneys. One of these proved quite difficult and forced 
		me to take off my sack; it finished with a little overhang containing 
		a triumphant vice-firm jam. A few slabs led to the top of the Zahn, whence 
		a rappel landed us in a br&ecirc;che. At this point or somewhere near 
		it Dave dropped the old red tobacco tin which contained the party’s stock 
		of cigarettes. It tinkled away down the Eastern slabs to an orchestration 
		of groans from the smokers. Roger Chorley, as the expedition’s ace photographer, 
		now asked David Fisher and Andr&eacute; Kopczynski to go ahead of us, 
		and we followed in their wake. We quickly came to a tall slab striated 
		with vertical blades that one laid back from, up, over, across and round 
		a corner, and that was the clue to the climb – when in doubt seize the 
		nearest edge and layback. </P>
	  <P>Clouds were 
		scudding up over the ridge, chasing the sunlight in and out of the pinnacles, 
		but you knew that they were not in earnest and that it was really fine. 
		The ridge soared ahead like a huge gust of laughter dispelling the gloom 
		of weeks, red, firm, spectacularly handsome. Pitch followed pitch, mostly 
		about grade IV, always exposed. Roger led an awkward little wall out of 
		a notch and belayed at the foot of the key passage with a meaning expression. 
		However, I had seen Andr&eacute;’s solution, and started up the slabby 
		wall; no snob, I clipped into all the pitons, and reached a very exposed 
		position on the sharp crest of the ridge where someone had thoughtfully 
		provided a stirrup of wire on which one could pause to reflect on the 
		scenery. Then hands on the saucer-edge of the world, feet flat on the 
		wall, and so up to a very small stance. The climb maintained its quality 
		to the last. It is the South ridge of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey in 
		miniature, and similarly does not end on the summit. After some interesting 
		climbing up and down the final towers, it becomes necessary to traverse 
		across to the South West face route and climb some steep earthy cracks 
		to the summit ridge. Along this to the West is a forty foot shark’s fin 
		on which is the true summit. Inevitably you climb it as a layback, by 
		now an automatic movement, and pose on its two-foot-square top for your 
		photograph. &quot;Sitting room for one on top – pass right down please.&quot; 
		Fortunately its descent is assured by a ring-spike cemented in the summit. 
		</P>
	  <P>When we 
		had all done this and some had sung a Dies Irae over the lost tobacco, 
		we looked around and saw weather making, so we went down the cow-track 
		which is the ordinary route and arrived at the glacier in about ten minutes. 
		Down this too, the snow soft, starting baby avalanches at each step. Then 
		a couloir, one after the other, simple stuff, and back to the hut via 
		some affable glissades. The climb had given us all we could have asked; 
		views, situations, excitement, laughter, friendship, security, confidence, 
		fine weather and a quick way down: all we had a right to expect, in a 
		bad season perhaps more. Evening brought beer and Wiener Schnitzel and 
		plans down in G&ouml;schenen. Contrast is the life-blood of the connoisseur 
		of living. I look back to the day as the quintessence of pleasure. </P>
	  <P>The West 
		face of the Pointe Albert has something in common with the South ridge 
		of the Salbytschin. It is a pleasant short route on a low peak, suitable 
		for climbing in dubious weather when bigger climbs may be out of condition. 
		To the expert climber, I hasten to remark, both will seem very small beer: 
		but they serve to illustrate my point, and to me the Albert was a different 
		affair. </P>
	  <P>The face 
		and I had some mutual history. At the end of August 1952 I had made an 
		attempt in the company of a very much better climber than myself, but 
		on the first V/VI pitch he had had the misfortune to pull out a piton 
		and had fallen thirty feet or so. He was not seriously hurt, but had strained 
		his back a little, and my hands were slightly the worse for wear. By the 
		time we were sorted out it was late, the unknown crux still above us, 
		weather making, and my morale not high. So we climbed down, and had the 
		satisfaction of sitting in a hot bath in the Hotel de Chamonix, while 
		the storm broke outside. Early in July 1953 I had re- visited the face 
		with Roger Chorley and John Lawton, but new snow covered the rocks. Reflecting 
		that we would not climb on Cloggy in such conditions, we gave up at the 
		first ledge and went across to the easier North North East ar&ecirc;te 
		instead. Later in the month the face was climbed by two very strong British 
		parties, all of whom were climbers out of my world. The season brought 
		successes and failures in about equal numbers as, to me, every season 
		does: though each brings equal enjoyment if the game is played honestly. 
		Finally a prolonged bad spell sent Roger home in disgust, but I hung on 
		hoping for one more climb. Joe Brown had just done the Albert, and was 
		encouraging. I asked Eileen Gregory to come to the North face of the Dru. 
		She replied that she didn’t want to do a TD. I countered by suggesting 
		an ED, the Albert. This was just what she had been secretly hoping for, 
		and she agreed at once. I had never done, far less led, an ED. We were 
		not nearly such a strong party as on the Salbytschin, and we were uncomfortably 
		short of rope. Altogether the issue seemed uncertain, but we decided to 
		try hard and retreat if it didn’t work. This storm in the teapot of my 
		emotions will seem ridiculous to many, but to me it was real enough at 
		the time, and I mention it because it is relevant to my theme. The motto 
		of British parties in recent years has been &quot;have a go,&quot; and 
		on the whole it has been wonderfully successful. The mountains cuff out 
		and messily flatten their opponents, but they have a way of rewarding 
		their true lovers. </P>
	  <P>Evening 
		saw us at the familiar chalet, cooking and listening to the wild applause 
		of the rain on the roof at the fierce gestures of lightning. We kept straight 
		faces, went early to bed, rose proportionally late; and I tried to take 
		no notice of the threatening sky or the butterflies in my tummy as we 
		plodded up under that very vertical face. It wasn’t exactly hateful, but 
		neither was it pleasure. A deliberate numbness really. But as soon as 
		I touched the rock I felt a little electric shock of confidence, and knew 
		I was going to climb well. We swung quickly across the switchback traverse 
		that leads to the centre of the face and the hard pitches. A loose chimney 
		and a little vertical wall led to a six inch ledge formed by the top of 
		a flake. While we sorted out the gear I gave Eileen a short resume of 
		the art of artificial climbing, to which she was about to be introduced. 
		Then I went up to the overhang, leaned back, clipped in, pulled, and so 
		on, and presently I was above it. This was where the fall had occurred, 
		and I tested the pitons with loving care. The place was exposed but there 
		war plenty of security. Finally it became impossible to move against the 
		drag of the rope through the karabiners below, but I found a sloping ledge 
		just big enough to hold both feet, and, sagging from a peg, brought up 
		Eileen. Then a stiff little crack and some zig-zagging about led to a 
		huge loose belay at the foot of the tall di&egrave;dre which is the main 
		feature of the face. A hundred feet of delicate bridging up this led to 
		.html &quot;relai deux pieds.&quot; As I felt the next pitch to be morally 
		the crux, my belay represented the ultimate in human ingenuity, and I 
		left Eileen securely if unluxuriously trussed to four coupled pitons. 
		A few moves on &eacute;triers brought me to a position where it was necessary 
		to make a difficult and exposed move leftwards and upwards to escape out 
		of the di&egrave;dre. There were words like a refrain in the back of my 
		mind, but concentration prevented me finding them at once. The holds were 
		awkward – what are those words? – then at full stretch I found a good 
		little layback edge and swung round into the easy chimney above, which 
		led to a giant ledge, and we were free of the di&egrave;dre. The words 
		defined themselves... Cym Smith’s birthday on Cloggy: &quot;The blackness 
		of the sky above, the terrific sweep of du’r Arddu below and the poundings 
		of the water on our backs made us suddenly conscious of the joy of living. 
		No climb can be hard when you feel like that.&quot; Then in my own small 
		way and easier circumstances I felt like that and for the only time in 
		my life I knew that nothing could stop us. </P>
	  <P>Eileen produced 
		some food but I was taut and keen to be off again. A loose gully of grade 
		III followed, and I found it the most trying pitch on the climb. Then 
		there was a delicate traverse to the right which reminded me of the Garden 
		Wall Traverse at Cromford. At the end there was a curious move down and 
		out over seemingly bottomless space to a boulder-cluttered ledge. Above 
		this a short chimney led to .html ledge beneath a rebarbative overhang. 
		Then I saw pitons out to the right and traversed on stirrups, feet swinging 
		gloriously dear of the rock, until it was possible to pull over on to 
		the slab above. The pitons here were among the least reassuring I have 
		seen, as bad as those on the artificial pitch of the East ridge of the 
		Crocodile. After the slab came a corner with inversed pitons. There seemed 
		to be a ledge above so I reached up. What an edge! Slack, I shouted, slack 
		damn you, but the drag was only the rope through the pegs, so I just pulled 
		fit to bust the rope and mantleshelfed with savage physical pleasure on 
		to a small flat comfortable nook twelve feet below the summit. When Eileen 
		came I found I had the choice of an easy crack or a &quot;retablissement 
		violent &quot;– no choice really: who could resist the latter? Over we 
		went and on to the summit laughing. This is the move I had seen pictured 
		in Pen y Gwyrd. The clouds had gathered; it was about to pelt. Parties 
		could be seen racing down from the Blaiti&egrave;re. Little men, we could 
		play the flea with nature, but if she showed her claws never so lightly 
		we must scuttle away. </P>
	  <P>The rain 
		came as we stepped off the glacier. Season’s end, and how better? It had 
		not been pleasure to-day. Fear first, then a kind of sober divine madness, 
		then joy. &quot;Joy,&quot; I chanted inside myself, &quot;joy,&quot; running 
		down through the rain, singing. </P>
