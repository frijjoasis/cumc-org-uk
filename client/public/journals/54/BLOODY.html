	  <P>THE invitation 
		of a warm dry June could not easily be denied and so in preparation for 
		the coming alpine season of 1952, four C.U.M.C. members decided to make 
		the most of the occasion by spending an energetic training week in the 
		Welsh hills. With George to follow the next day, Ted, Brian and I arrived 
		at Ynys Ettws hut at about 4 p.m. one Monday evening � just time enough 
		to complete three climbs in the Llanberis valley before nightfall. Brian, 
		who had previously only led through on one VS. was put through his paces 
		by first following &quot;West Rib&quot; on Dinas Mot, leading through 
		The Nose Direct and finally leading &quot;Brant &quot; on Clogwyn y Grochan, 
		with his second following up the unpleasantly fierce Direct Start. </P>
	  <P>With everyone 
		apparently on form we set out eagerly the next morning for perhaps the 
		greatest of all British cliffs � Clogwyn du�r Arddu. </P>
	  <P>For some 
		time both Ted and I had been considering the possibility of forcing a 
		route up the previously attempted, but still unclimbed, far west wall 
		of Cloggy�s West Buttress. This smooth and overhanging portion of the 
		Buttress was known both on account of its nature and its reddish colour, 
		as Bloody Slab. A name as well as an adequate description of what was 
		to be expected. </P>
	  <P>On our arrival 
		at the foot of the cliff we moved up the screes and along to the obvious 
		rake on the right with the intention of starting the climb at the far 
		right of the slab proper. At this point the slab could actually be gained 
		with ease from the rake without having to overcome the fierce overhangs 
		characteristic of the base of Cloggy. From the far side of the rake we 
		were able to examine the prospects of the first pitch. The results were 
		not very encouraging. The slab was very smooth and, under the overhangs, 
		nearly always damp. Added to this was the fact that most of the climbing 
		would depend on pure friction owing to the apparent lack of any obvious 
		holds. Those holds that we could see all sloped the wrong way because 
		of the overlapping structure of the rock. On the whole a rather discouraging 
		picture, but nevertheless still worth a try. I can remember thinking quite 
		happily at the time � &quot;Never say die till you�re dead!&quot; </P>
	  <P>Within five 
		minutes I had led off in rubbers at the end of 200 feet of Nylon medium 
		bought by Ted for use in the Alps. With me I had � one piton (removed 
		from Little Tryfan the previous Easter), a piton hammer and five nylon 
		slings with karabiners. Starting at the far right of the slab, the first 
		few feet across some large flakes went quite easily and a running belay 
		was possible after about twenty feet. At this point the climb was leading 
		diagonally upwards to the left, while the rake sloped down in the same 
		direction, causing a vastly increased feeling of exposure as the climb 
		progressed. Above the first runner the following fifteen feet showed increasing 
		difficulty, until again a rather insecure runner was possible. </P>
	  <P>From here 
		on the climb became quite thin and now it is difficult to recall how the 
		next thirty feet were managed at all. At one stage the only means of moving 
		up was by reaching at full stretch with the right hand to finger-jam in 
		the bottom of a vertical crack about eighteen inches long and half an 
		inch wide. By pulling up on this and then body-leaning to the left it 
		was possible to swing up to the level of the top of the crack. At this 
		critical point a quick call from an ever watchful second pointed to the 
		only possible foothold about two feet away to the left. This allowed a 
		moment�s respite in a more or less bridged position which, itself being 
		very tiring and with the previous move being apparently impossible to 
		reverse, left no alternative but to go on up. With the difficult move 
		below and the uncertainty of what was still to come, life at this point 
		seemed to depend more upon faith than friction. </P>
	  <P>Still, after 
		the second runner, the slab was dry and tiny flakes allowed pleasantly 
		delicate finger and toe climbing to lead to a somewhat doubtful flake 
		behind which placement of the only piton manufactured .html runner. 
		This was about seventy feet from the start and about a hundred feet from 
		the rake directly below with still no possibility of a stance, belay or 
		even a resting place. About fifteen feet above was the first large overhang 
		in the middle of the slab and the third runner made for much more confident 
		climbing up to the base of this. At this point the first real handhold 
		of the climb was manufactured by extensive &quot;gardening&quot; in the 
		crack immediately below the overhang. Here the general dampness and moss 
		made rubbers both useless and dangerous, so they had to be removed quickly 
		and tucked away in case they were necessary later on. The climb was continued 
		in socks, and with the newly found &quot;Thank God&quot; hold, a stretch 
		round the over- hang to the left enabled a small undercut handhold to 
		be used by the left hand for a pull round the corner and up to a neat 
		little ledge just to the left and above the bottom of the overhang. </P>
	  <P>After a 
		rest here, on what was a reasonable stance, it became obvious that there 
		were no belays in the vicinity. However, on the right along the side of 
		the overhang an obvious layback crack of fifteen odd feet led to the possibility 
		of a runner behind a rather shaky flake. On return to the ledge the route 
		became only too obvious! The ledge itself was on the top of an overhang; 
		there was an overhanging wall on the right; and directly above were what 
		the guide-book terms &quot;The obvious overhangs of Bloody Slab.&quot; 
		The only way led diagonally upwards and across the smooth and exposed 
		slab to the left. Fifteen feet. away to the left was a thin vertical grassy 
		crack and between this and the ledge the only holds were very tiny vertical 
		ribs: in effect the ideal place for a horizontal rappel! This was done 
		by using the rope through the runner on the shaky flake which allowed 
		a precarious crab-like movement to be made across into the grassy crack. 
		</P>
	  <P>From this 
		point on the upper slab proper it was possible to climb diagonally up 
		to the left on tiny finger and toe holds with the occasional use of a 
		clump of grass y owing in thin vertical cracks. At one stage when embracing 
		such a strip of grass with hands and feet the top portion came away from 
		the crack and started to peel off, rolling down from the top like a thin 
		green carpet. With a seventy foot lead-out from the last runner � the 
		shaky flake � the situation was critical and the piton hammer was rapidly 
		brought into use to cut off the detached part of the clump before the 
		whole thing rolled right off. Quick movement off the grass was of course 
		quite impossible owing to the thin and delicate nature of the climb. On 
		the upper portion of the slab there was no trace of any real hold so all 
		movements had to be carefully studied in order to maintain three good 
		points of contact with the rock while looking for, or making, the next 
		move. </P>
	  <P>Shifting 
		carefully off the grass, movement could again be made diagonally upward 
		to the left on very tiny rugosities until .html large loose flake was 
		reached. This appeared to be resting on a useful little ledge, so, bridged 
		on very small toe holds, it proved quite a surprise when a tentative pull 
		removed the whole issue � all twenty odd pounds of it! This presented 
		an awkward problem, more so in view of the fact that I was holding on 
		it! One could, of course, hold the flake against the tock, but not for 
		long, and it was too heavy to throw clear without falling off. Throwing 
		would of course also remove two very good handholds � and if I dropped 
		it � well my feet were just below. Ted and Brian down below could not 
		have known what was going on until, with a little push to the left, I 
		half dropped, half threw it just dear of my left foot to slither noisily 
		down the slab and over the overhang to crash, after a moment�s silence, 
		to the screes below. </P>
	  <P>Just to 
		complete the picture, the groove from which the flake had come was rounded 
		top and bottom with no trace of the hoped for hold. Almost desperate examination 
		of the rock, however, revealed a tiny flake the top of which was craftily 
		knocked off with the hammer to produce a neat little quarter inch ledge. 
		Using this as a fingerhold a move could again be made across and up to 
		.html grassy strip, Proceeding super-carefully up this (a ninety foot 
		lead-out from the shaky flake runner), it again became possible to move 
		on to the more rugose left edge of the slab which led up to a good grassy 
		ledge just to the right of the &quot;Obvious overhangs &quot; (Quote, 
		Llanberis guide). </P>
	  <P>At this 
		point, like all good things, the two hundred feet of rope came to an end 
		and the trouble really started. Ted moved a few feet up the climb, to 
		allow me to belay, and then started up. After about thirty feet it became 
		obvious that not only would the climb extend either of the seconds but 
		that the diagonal route placed the second in a no less dangerous position 
		than the leader. Should he come off he would naturally swing out to the 
		left over the overhangs, from which position no amount of pulling on the 
		part of the leader could get him up, nor could the two hundred feet of 
		rope reach any point of safety from which it would be possible to get 
		off the slab. This also meant that it was impossible for me to abseil 
		from the ledge on which I was belayed. Two hundred feet could not nearly 
		reach the rake directly below the ledge, and to return along the way I 
		had come was, to my mind, unthinkable. The problem in a nutshell was that 
		I did not think that I could climb down and the others did not think they 
		could climb up � a mountaineer�s nightmare, especially so on a cliff like 
		&quot;Cloggy.&quot; </P>
	  <P>At this 
		point deep thought, and much head scratching, brought to mind Joe Brown�s 
		feat on &quot;The Boulder&quot;; of course, the only thing to do was to 
		go on unroped in the hope that at least the major problems had been already 
		overcome. </P>
	  <P>This actually 
		proved to be the case and after gazing wistfully at the white end of rope 
		slithering out of sight down the slab, I turned to tackle what proved 
		to be two more pitches of comparatively little difficulty which eventually 
		led to the easy broken rock characteristic of the top of the Cloggy ridge. 
		</P>
	  <P>A few moments 
		later I had gained the top to join Ted and Brian, who had continued up 
		the rake to the west and on up to the top. After meeting we returned again 
		down the rake and en route paused to examine again the line of the first 
		few pitches now well shown up by the slings, piton and carabiners remaining 
		there as the spoils of the chase for the next party. </P>
	  <P>I considered 
		the first pitch delicate and continuously difficult enough to warrant 
		classifying the climb as "exceptionally severe" in the Ynys Ettws log. 
		However, as it was presumably a first ascent, which always makes a climb 
		seem harder than it really is, I have a rather sneaking feeling that some 
		later party will return from Cloggy and enter in the log book: "Bloody 
		Slab - a pleasant little climb. Possibly Very Difficult." </P>
