	  <P>(Monday, 
		24th August, 1953). </P>
	  <P>FOR three 
		of us, Derek Augood of King’s, John Williams of St. John’s and myself, 
		it was our first holiday in the Alps, and thanks to the patience and competence 
		of Bob Stevenson of Sidney Sussex, it was a good holiday. But perhaps 
		of all our expeditions, the day which stood out most clearly in our minds 
		was the one on which we climbed the Nadelhorn, Lenzspitze and Dom. </P>
	  <P>After having 
		spent nearly a fortnight in the Saas-Fee area we had decided that we were 
		probably fit enough to undertake the somewhat formidable task of walking 
		up to the Mischabel Hut, and we had arrived there the previous Thursday 
		evening. On Friday we had climbed the Lenzspitze intending to do the traverse 
		of the Nadelgrat, but had been forced to return the way we had come by 
		bad weather, under the circumstances a slippery operation. Saturday had 
		been frightful, the temperature in the hut being three degrees below freezing 
		point, and some fresh snow had fallen. On Sunday we had made an abortive 
		attempt to climb the Nadelhorn, but had again been forced to return, this 
		time without reaching the top. But in spite of the wind and the cold the 
		weather now was showing signs of improvement. Early the next morning we 
		again packed our rucksacks and sitting round the table squeezed the last 
		of the condensed milk into our tea and hurriedly ate unwanted food, and 
		this time we did leave not to return, and wound our way up the boulder 
		strewn track to the point where the two routes up the Lenzspitze and the 
		Nadelhorn fork. As on the previous day, we climbed the Nadelhorn ridge 
		passing, as the sun was beginning to rise, the place where we turned back, 
		and the summit was reached about seven o’clock. This is a pleasant and 
		easy snow ridge with approximately two hundred feet of scrambling immediately 
		below the top. We had originally intended to do the Stecknadelhorn and, 
		spending the night at the Dom Hut, continue to Zermatt the following day. 
		However, my three companions decided unanimously to do the Nadelgrat traverse 
		onto the Lenzspitze, and as it was still early, from there to do the traverse 
		of the Lenzspitze and Dom. I can remember thinking that the Dom looked 
		an exceedingly long way away and realising a little dismally that there 
		was nothing for it but to agree. </P>
	  <P>The Nadelgrat 
		is quite magnificent and I imagine well justifies its reputation as being 
		one of the finest ridge climbs in the Saas-Fee area. One half is rock 
		nearest the Nadelhorn and the other snow leading to the summit of the 
		Lenzspitze. It is quite sensational (and particularly impressive in photographs), 
		but under good conditions not difficult. We ate a sardine on the top of 
		the Lenzspitze, and found it really hard to believe that it was indeed 
		the same place where we had been three days previously in a driving snow- 
		storm, and that the sunlit ridge, along which we had just come, was that 
		razor snow edge, that had been seen disappearing so alarmingly into a 
		deep void of grey mist and snow. </P>
	  <P>From the 
		Lenzspitze we descended the comparatively rotten ridge to the Lenzjoch, 
		a ridge which exhibits one amazing and terrifyingly contorted gendarme. 
		The route at this point is fairly easy to find and there are a number 
		of variant ways. From the Lenzjoch, Bob and I made use of our crampons 
		by doing a short but to me rather alarming traverse across a steep frozen 
		snow slope of about 45 degrees angle onto the main massif of the Dom. 
		There we found that Derek and John had been waiting some time, having 
		presumably followed the normal route which entailed doing a rock pitch, 
		and which we thought we would avoid by a more interesting variation! Apparently 
		the pitch was easier than it looked. From there we joined the ordinary 
		route up the Dom from the Dom Hut, and I have no very clear picture of 
		this part of the expedition other than a vivid impression of a snow slope, 
		which seemed somehow to be highly symbolical of Eternity. </P>
	  <P>We climbed 
		the whole day on two ropes except on the descent or crossing glaciers, 
		when we went on one, Bob and I together and John and Derek. The whole 
		day we met only one other party on their way up the Dom as we were coming 
		down. They had done the Lenzspitze-Dom traverse and rather surprised us 
		by in- forming us that they had seen John’s pen-knife, which he had left 
		on the top of the Lenzspitze, although they had apparently seen fit to 
		leave it there, no doubt bearing indubitable witness to the absolute honesty 
		of all mountaineering parties, but nevertheless rather irritating. </P>
	  <P>Suffering 
		rather inordinately from that spiritual pride peculiar to all mountaineers 
		on reaching their objective, we had a late lunch on the top of the Dom, 
		ending traditionally with Kendal Mint Cake. It was exceedingly pleasant. 
		There was a slight breeze, and if the temperature was not exactly conducive 
		to sun-bathing, at least the sky was cloudless, everywhere there were 
		mountains and below in a thousand valleys were little isolated patches 
		of mist. Near to, the Matterhorn appeared as a somewhat cheeky rocky prominence 
		registering a certain individualism which did not seem quite to fit the 
		scheme of things. Such independence was out of place in this panorama 
		of giants as Monte Rosa and the Weisshorn and in the far distance Mont 
		Blanc. </P>
	  <P>Curiously, 
		at this height of just under fifteen thousand feet, we saw a large and 
		colourful butterfly flitting from rock to rock as (apparently) contented 
		as if it were in some botanical garden. John, by way of being an amateur 
		lepidopterist, although until then unbeknown to us, was much impressed. 
		</P>
	  <P>Before leaving 
		the top we took our leave of Saas-Fee, which had been our H.Q. for the 
		past fortnight, and wondered whether Heinrich Supersaxo, the head guide 
		there, who had in the past given us much advice, was pointing at us his 
		vast telescope on the verandah of his pension, and telling his guests 
		(as he had told us on our first arrival) that if they looked quickly now 
		they would be able to see four persons on the top of the Dom. </P>
	  <P>The descent 
		to the Festijoch was fast and the afternoon sun was hot, and I for my 
		part had omitted to put on any sun-burn cream, an omission which I afterwards 
		regretted. The route we took, the ordinary way up the Dom was uneventful, 
		and so long as we were on snow was well marked and made a wide, and judging 
		by the number of recently fallen blocks of ice, necessary detour of a 
		series of amazing ice-pinnacles. From the Festijoch, where we left the 
		snow, we had some slight difficulty in route finding, descending a steep 
		and extremely rotten slope leading onto the glacier, where we picked up 
		the track again and eventually reached the Dom Hut about five o’clock. 
		</P>
	  <P>The expedition 
		afforded more varied aspects of Alpine climbing than we had hitherto experienced 
		and was most enjoyable, and I think we can well recommend it to others. 
		</P>
