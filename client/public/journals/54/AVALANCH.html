	  <P>IT was at 
		Camp Nine that we finally saw the source of the constant avalanches. For 
		some days we had been hearing their distant rumblings but their view had 
		been hidden by the intervening ridges. Across from us now was a high-hanging 
		glacier fully two miles broad from the suspended edge of which originated 
		the largest avalanches we had ever seen. </P>
	  <P>Thousands 
		of tons of bluish-white ice would shear away from a height as great. as 
		16,000 feet. Gaining in size and spectacular beauty, the ice falls would 
		shoot over a vertical cliff of dark gneissic rock and slide out into space 
		half a mile or more before landing with a low-throated roar on the flat 
		of a glacier out of sight below. We estimated that the surface of this 
		glacier was at an elevation of 3,500 feet, which meant that some of the 
		avalanches dropped straight down for two to two and one-half miles. During 
		the several days spent at this camp, we had a ring-side seat to this incessant 
		display of natural forces at work. Even at night, we could hear the reverberating 
		echoes far down-valley. </P>
	  <P>The greatest 
		release of ice was from sunset to midnight, while the snow avalanches 
		were most frequent during midday. The ice falls had a secondary period 
		of activity in the early hours too, after the morning sun warmed the cliffs 
		and melting began to take place. The lubricating effect of melt-water 
		would facilitate the discharge of more ice blocks from their hanging positions, 
		with the periodicity of fall being most frequent up until about ten o’clock 
		in the morning. Oddly, we found the ice avalanches occurred least frequently 
		in the hottest hours of the afternoon. In the evening, after shadows began 
		to stretch across the range and sunlight no longer touched those clinging 
		heights of ice which faced towards the south, melt-water would again freeze 
		and the resultant expansion in minute cracks and openings of the glacier 
		would cause a renewed period of intense activity. Then, other masses would 
		break and fall away to leave gaping holes in the terminus which ominously 
		capped the rim of black rock cliff. </P>
	  <P>Fortunately, 
		we were on a ridge so that there was no danger of the ice falls blocking 
		our route ahead. Nothing could reach us from above. There was only the 
		problem of material sliding out from below the track of our route. In 
		this regard, a different pattern of avalanches was found on snow slopes 
		which we traversed. During the warmer summer days, the snow surfaces would 
		ablate. Some of the resultant water evaporated into space but much of 
		it percolated downward through the snow-pack to produce saturated levels 
		of snow on top of. hidden surfaces of underlying ice. This often resulted 
		in a treacherous condition in which whole areas would break loose and 
		slide on the smooth underlayer. In places where a rougher topography controlled, 
		the slopes would become riven with tiny gulleys formed by a multitude 
		of individual currents of moving snow. It was most disconcerting to watch 
		the snow- cover disappear as if it were water pouring over the crest of 
		a cliff. </P>
	  <P>Because 
		of this, we were more concerned with this type of slide than with the 
		more spectacular but distant ice falls. In the winter and spring, dry 
		snow and wind-slab avalanches would prevail; but at the time of our expedition, 
		wet mid-summer conditions were the rule at all elevations up to 12,000 
		feet. Although we were fairly safe on the ridge, the tiny snowballs stirred 
		up by our steps would, within a few hundred feet, grow into torrential 
		slides. The roar that echoed from the canyons below would tell us the 
		devastation that our little snowballs had caused. </P>
	  <P>These saturated 
		slopes were dangerous and wholly unpredictable. If the snow-cover did 
		not actually break loose, the entire mass would often settle with a frightening 
		crunch. On one occasion this happened while six of us, in two ropes of 
		three, were traversing relatively gentle terrain. As we looked up, a few 
		feet beyond eye-level, we could see that a thin line of demarcation had 
		suddenly formed. The snow-pack was poised for flight so we beat a hasty 
		retreat to camp and travelled no more that day. </P>
	  <P>From experiences 
		such as this, we turned our nights into days and travelled only when the 
		shadows lengthened and the evening cold had refrozen the slopes. </P>
	  <P>Night travel 
		not only minimised snow avalanches but offered easier going. On a firm, 
		frozen surface, we could move fast, while during sunlight hours the same 
		slope would be softened to such an extent that on occasions we would even 
		sink up to our hips – a condition which not only made progress unsafe 
		but slow and tedious. And so, during the long hours of sub-Arctic twilight, 
		we were able to make our way safely and rapidly along the mute. Night 
		climbing – a technique to be looked upon with disfavour in other circumstances 
		– became at once an expedient and a blessing. </P>
	  <P>Beyond the 
		technical aspects of the climb, these were the conditions we encountered 
		as we reconnoitered the upper reaches of our peak. Two more days were 
		necessary before the attempt on the summit could be made. </P>
	  <P>A supporting 
		aircraft came in and dropped supplies at 13,000 feet. The loads were successfully 
		received on a narrow wind-swept ledge less than 50 square yards in area. 
		All, that is, except two large boxes of rations which missed and hurtled 
		down the adjacent 8,000-foot cliff. But in spite of the food loss, Camp 
		Ten was sufficiently well stocked to outlast a week of storm. From this 
		position we moved up to establish our final camp at 15,400 feet. It was 
		by then July 14th. </P>
	  <P>Despite 
		a high wind and driving clouds of powdered snow, we made an attempt on 
		the remaining 2,400 feet of rock-and-ice ridge the next day. The weather 
		was deteriorating rapidly so when one of us fell through an unseen snow 
		bridge into a crevasse, we decided to retreat to camp and hole in with 
		prayers for clearing skies. There was only enough food left for two days. 
		If conditions grew worse we would certainly have no choice but to turn 
		back The forced rest, however, was welcome since we had been pressing 
		hard in the past few days. </P>
	  <P>On July 
		16th, the sea of storm clouds had lowered below the 15,000 foot level 
		and formed a floor for the blue ceiling which fortunately prevailed overhead. 
		This was indeed good luck be- cause it gave us the chance we needed for 
		the final attempt. We started out at 7 a.m., but a few hundred yards from 
		camp, Bill Putnam began having trouble breathing because of a lung wound 
		which he had received during the war. He returned to the high camp tents 
		and remained in his sleeping bag while the rest of us went on. </P>
	  <P>Ten hours 
		later we were at 17,700 feet. The final 300 feet of the climb offered 
		some of the most difficult ice work in the whole ascent. We had been alternating 
		leads with each of two ropes so that one man wouldn’t take the brunt of 
		chopping steps at this fatiguing altitude. I can remember that Dee Molenaar 
		was first on the rope on a steep ridge that rose to the summit. He was 
		chopping his way laboriously up a long series of ice hummocks that stretched 
		like a castellated ridge to the north. We thought that the summit was 
		at the very end of this series of ice humps some 500 feet farther on and 
		were preparing to shift leads when his sudden yodel from above told us 
		that he had reached the highest mound. </P>
	  <P>The rest 
		of us dragged ourselves along an extremely narrow ridge that led to the 
		tiny summit plateau about half the size of a tennis court. Nothing was 
		higher. Although eight other expeditions had attempted this peak only 
		one had ever reached this point before. That was in 1897 when the Duke 
		of Abruzzi attained it by .html route from the east. </P>
	  <P>The temperature 
		read zero in a 40 mile-an-hour wind. Below us lay en echelon ranges of 
		peaks, the higher summits of which probed through the boiling layer of 
		storm clouds which had closed in more tightly during the afternoon, but 
		which fortunately still rested one mile below us. We looked down upon 
		these other summits with that paradoxical feeling of being somewhat of 
		the master of all we saw and yet in the same instant we were completely 
		insignificant. But there wasn’t any time nor was their any comfort in 
		musing on such thoughts. One member of our team had already felt the symptoms 
		of frost-bitten feet. </P>
	  <P>The boundary 
		between Canada and Alaska passes across the spot where we stood. In classical 
		fashion we hastily took photo- graphs of the American and Canadian flags, 
		each placed on its respective side of this highest point on the international 
		border. Then we adjusted our ropes and started down. </P>
	  <P>We had reached 
		the summit on an auspicious date. July 16th was the 205th anniversary 
		of the day the Danish sea captain, Vitus Bering, discovered Alaska. As 
		an explorer in the employ of the Russian Czar, he had sighted the icy 
		top of our mountain from 140 miles at sea. It was on that day that he 
		had named this great peak Mt. St. Elias, thus honouring the patron Saint 
		whose feast day this was in the calendar of the Russian Greek Orthodox 
		Church. </P>
	  <P>We remembered 
		the avalanches and other difficulties of the long climb which had brought 
		us from the terminus of a tide-water glacier on the Alaskan coast 25 miles 
		away to this remote height at 18,008 feet on the edge of an unexplored 
		sector of the Yukon Territory. We were to know again on the descent the 
		misery of back-packing days across the subsidiary ridges and ranges which 
		so far had exacted from us 31 days of mountaineering effort. Had the Saint 
		temporarily relented his petulant moods for only this brief moment? We 
		suspect he had, because in the next few hours, the long-’awaited storm 
		smashed down and continued unrelentingly for the full three weeks of our 
		descent and return to the coast. </P>
