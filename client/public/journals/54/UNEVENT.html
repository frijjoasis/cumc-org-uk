	  <P>WHILE we 
		were stuck in Tromso for a fortnight last August, waiting for a trawler 
		to take us and our equipment back to Grimsby, some of us got together 
		and decided to do a few climbs. We were the relics of yet .html of the 
		interminable Cambridge Spitsbergen Expeditions, but, as has always been 
		the case, scientific work had come before peak bagging, and the amount 
		of climbing done in Spitsbergen was negligible. In Tromso, how- ever, 
		we were blessed with fine, warm weather, part of the best summer they 
		had known there for years, and unlimited time, which did a little to offset 
		the fact that the town is very badly situated for getting at any of the 
		peaks except the Tromsdaltind, a large lump of a mountain, of the size 
		and general shape of Nevis. It .stands across the head of a long valley 
		running east from the town, with its long dull slope falling into the 
		valley head, blunt ridges curving away to the north and south, and steep 
		rock walls falling to the north and east, on the face hidden from Tromso. 
		It would appear to be quite a popular ascent from the town, by a path 
		up the screes onto the northern ridge, and it was by this line that we 
		intended to walk up when we set off at nine in the morning, across the 
		ferry to the mainland, and up a dusty track among the beech and hazel 
		scrub in the valley. </P>
	  <P>As the day 
		passed it became very hot, with a dry thirsty heat that made us delay 
		frequently to gather handfuls of succulent bilberries. Nevertheless, an 
		hour and a half brought us to the point where we had to cross the bubbling 
		mountain stream and make our way up onto the north containing ridge of 
		the valley. We lost our path here, and had to force our way through the 
		scrub and saplings, inevitably collecting an occasional stinging lash 
		across the face, until at last we stood on open ground directly beneath 
		the steep scree shoulder of the north ridge. It was coming on for lunch-time 
		then, so we plodded up into the western coire, looking for water, but 
		found none. Tongues lolling out we traipsed back onto the shoulder, about 
		fifteen hundred feet above sea-level, and from there we could see a string 
		of tiny lochans in a shallow valley running along the north side of the 
		mountain, perhaps half a mile away. With blissful visions of wallowing 
		in cool water we hurried down, nibbled at a Ministry of Food dried meat 
		block, quenched our thirst, and dived thankfully into the cooling waters 
		of the tarn. </P>
	  <P>It was quite 
		the coldest reception I had ever, wittingly or unwittingly, let myself 
		in for. Imagine jumping into a cold bath in the middle of the cold spell 
		last winter, and you can imagine our feelings. </P>
	  <P>However, 
		this dip revived the party after the stifling heat of the valley, and 
		as we dried off in the sun, we plotted a climb up the five hundred feet 
		of slabs which are exposed on this side of the north ridge. The slabs 
		are extensive, and generally featureless, but with many grassy grooves 
		and ledges intersecting them. On the whole they looked quite steep, and 
		on closer acquaintance it was found to be rather like the east face of 
		Tryfan, steep but with good holds, and with all the difficulties avoidable 
		by detours up steep vegetation. The rock itself was a remarkably sound 
		garnet schist, where each tiny garnet, the size of a pea, made a small 
		but satisfying finger or toe hold by which to climb the smooth slabs. 
		Giles Brindley led the way, choosing an interesting line which brought 
		us into a tiny alcove below a bulge, which was surmounted by a hard and 
		delightful crack, leading onto a steep arete with small holds. This pitch 
		was the nicest to climb, and if taken direct about very difficult, the 
		rest of the ground being fairly uniform at Difficult. Taking in all about 
		an hour for the climb we reached the main ridge, four hundred yards from 
		the summit, at one-thirty. </P>
	  <P>As we walked 
		up to the cairn we were very impressed by the steep rocks of the north 
		east shoulder, and east face, which fall several hundred feet direct from 
		the ridge to a steep little glacier, and not less by the magnificent views 
		eastwards towards the Lyngen peninsula, where a magnificent array of jagged 
		peaks filled almost a third of the horizon; For us the greatest attraction 
		was a fine pointed cone of rock some four miles distant across a deep 
		valley to the east. It stood at the junction of three ridges, a very long 
		west ridge rising out of the valley, a short and exceptionally steep north 
		ridge, and a south-east ridge which curved round by way of two other fine 
		peaks to enclose a coire on the south-west of the summit. In both the 
		coires visible to us there were small glaciers. It was obviously the next 
		climb for us, and as we wandered on around the ridge in the late afternoon 
		we had already begun to consider ways and means of getting to it, the 
		chief objection being that it would need a whole day to get there and 
		back, and we were expecting that a trawler might sail in at as little 
		as a few hours notice. </P>
	  <P>Next day 
		in Tromso we did a little research, and found that the name of our peak 
		was Kamperrokken, about 3,500 ft., and that we could get to a point on 
		the main Narvik road four miles from its base by bus at 9.00 next morning. 
		We also satisfied ourselves that the arrival of a trawler was improbable, 
		and next morning a party of four of us, armed with ropes, and an extensive 
		supply of food, caught the Narvik bus. Pat Parks had joined the three 
		of us who had gone up the Tromsdaltind, Giles Brindley, Tony Hallam, and 
		myself, chiefly because we were uncertain as to what sort of climb we 
		were up against. From a distance it had looked very imposing, and we were 
		expecting something of a fairly high standard of difficulty, where two 
		parties might be better than three on one rope. When we arrived at the 
		road fork it was raining lightly from high clouds, and the air was sticky 
		and warm. In shirt-sleeve order we walked up the branch road among the 
		woods, passing several small shacks, with corrugated iron roofs, and white 
		painted. wooden walls, and meeting on the way a party of three Laps, dressed 
		in their attractive and brightly coloured national dress. These people 
		would appear to be in the same position socially over there as are the 
		gipsies in this country. </P>
	  <P>After some 
		three miles we reached a point where the long west ridge of our mountain 
		descended to the road as a steep, thickly wooded shoulder. It had stopped 
		raining, but the air was still filthily sticky. Once again the temptation 
		of ripe bilberries proved too much for us, and we made our way uphill 
		a good deal slower than the thick scrub warranted, but eventually we got 
		out onto open hillside about two thousand feet up, not far below the start 
		of the ridge proper. There was a slight breeze too, which cleared the 
		cloud from the tops, and made the heat a little more endurable. The man 
		who was carrying the rucksack decided it was time for lunch, a cunning 
		move since he had only taken it over ten minutes before. After lunch who 
		should find himself carrying it on the last stage of the slog but Patrick 
		Parks! </P>
	  <P>The view 
		from the first of the many tops along the east ridge was as good as we 
		had hoped, and from this much closer range, and greater height, the peak 
		of Kamperrokken presented a fine spectacle, the obvious line of attack 
		seeming to be the right hand skyline, which now looked very feasible. 
		We were separated from it by the best part of a mile of Cuillin like ridge, 
		with many high- lights, plenty of scrambling, and a nice sense of exposure. 
		We had at last become conscious of a sense of the passing hours, and decided 
		that a degree of hurrying was indicated if we hoped to be back at the 
		road fork by six o’clock to catch our bus. We covered the ridge in good 
		time, and arrived at the final pyramid quite warm. The way was now plain 
		to see, and we reached the top by way of a shallow gully on the south-west 
		face, finishing up an exposed mantleshelf directly onto the summit plateau, 
		about the size of a table top, with our ropes still nicely coiled and 
		unused. </P>
	  <P>Investigations 
		in the depths of the cairn revealed a tin with several pieces of paper 
		and cardboard, presumably bearing the names of the previous visitors, 
		although most were illegible. A tentative investigation of the prospects 
		of climbing up or down either of the two remaining ridges, satisfied us 
		that they were positively bleak. In the interest of saving time we abandoned, 
		reluctantly I like to think, the idea of traversing around the head of 
		the coire, and descended by the shallow gully. Then down a thousand feet 
		of screes, to a small lake set beneath a vast crag to the south, rimmed 
		with ice, and with the odd small iceberg drifting about in it. Giles and 
		I arrived steaming like horses, and, profiting little from our previous 
		experience, stripped and dived in. As cold receptions go, this one was 
		altogether exceptional. The Tromsdaltind lake lost its reputation as my 
		silliest bathe at the same moment as my head entered the water. It was 
		too late to draw back then, but it enjoys the reputation of my quickest 
		bathe as well as my coldest. </P>
	  <P>Pat and 
		Tony caught us up, and we pushed on down an interminable valley filled 
		with moraine, which gave us nearly a mile of boulder hopping before we 
		reached the forest. Time was running very short indeed, and as Pat had 
		gone lame in the boulder field, Tony and I went on ahead, with the probably 
		idle hope of delaying the bus until Giles and Pat could make it. As it 
		turned out, the bus was late, and worse, it was full up, and went sailing 
		past without so much as a toot on the horn. We thought this was a poor 
		way to encourage tourists, and set off walking, hoping for a lift. Of 
		course, from the moment of the passing of the bus, there was ’ scarcely 
		a vehicle to be seen. Two hours later Pat fell out, and spent the night 
		in a farm, continuing by bus the next morning, while the rest of us walked 
		until eleven in the evening, when at last we hitched a van which took 
		us back to Tromso. Thus ended a pleasant interlude in an otherwise uneventful 
		fortnight. </P>
