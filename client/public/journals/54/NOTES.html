	  </DIV>
	  <H2>EVEREST, S.E. RIDGE ROUTE. </H2>
	  <P>11,102 feet. 
		Difficult (Hard). Oxygen. </P>
	  <P>First Ascent: 
		29th May, 1953. Hillary, Tenzing (leading through). Others, unable to 
		follow, were: Hunt (Leader), Band (C.U.M.C.), Bourdillon, Evans, Gregory, 
		Lowe, Morris, Noyce (C.U.M.C.), Pugh, 35 Sherpas, Stobart, Ward (C.U.M.C.), 
		Westmacott, Wylie. Time; 7 weeks. Rope 1,500 feet. A fine route on snow 
		and ice with a little rock on the last three pitches. </P>
	  <P>Start: At 
		17,900 feet from a patch of moraine on the Khumbu Glacier. </P>
	  <P>(1) 2,300 
		feet. Follow the glacier to the Icefall. Climb unstable blocks and pinnacles 
		of ice avoiding large crevasses and rickety seracs. Journalists ’should 
		not lead too immediately here. </P>
	  <P>(2) 2,100 
		feet. The Western Cwm. Easily along the big sloping snow ledge until the 
		face ahead steepens. </P>
	  <P>(3) 3,550 
		feet. The Lhotse Face. The crux. Up a series of steep ice walls alternating 
		with shelving snow covered ledges. After 2,700 feet, make a rising traverse 
		left up a snow gully on the right of a prominent rock rib. The rib is 
		joined and climbed to the top. Descend 200 feet – this may be found difficult 
		in reverse – to a roomy but unattractive stance. Much energy expended 
		here. </P>
	  <P>(4) 2,850 
		feet. Join the S.E, Ridge after 1,350 feet by the obvious snow gully. 
		Follow the ridge. A steep, possibly dangerous, snow slope of 400 feet 
		leads to the South Summit. This was avoided in a variant by Evans and 
		Bourdillon on a preliminary inspection by climbing snow covered rocks 
		well to the left. </P>
	  <P>(5) 302 
		feet. A formidable looking pitch. Descend a few feet and continue along 
		the ridge on its left face, slightly below the crest. At half distance, 
		a 40 foot chimney between rock and ice provides the key to an interesting 
		finish. Cut over successive ice humps to the summit. </P>
	  <P>The same 
		route was used in descent. A stronger party might find the traverse completed 
		by the N.E. Ridge feasible and more satisfying. </P>
	  <H2>THE ALPS (1953). </H2>
	  <H3>SALBVTSCHIN, S. RIDGE. </H3>
	  <P>D. R. Fisher, 
		A. Kopczynski (NM), Hon. R. R. E. Chorley, G. J. Sutton. Some time during 
		July. A most enjoyable and recommendable route, likely to remain in condition 
		even in a bad season. We thought it about TD. inf. with three pitches 
		of V and several of IV. Quite sustained and exposed. I do not remember 
		exactly what time we started, probably about 7 a.m. Seven hours of unhurried 
		progress took us from the hut over the Zahn to the summit. One ice-axe 
		and no claws suffice a whole party for the descent. Good rock and good 
		assurance. </P>
	  <H3>PUNTA INNOMINATA (BERGELL) W. RIDGE. </H3>
	  <P>During July. 
		G. J. Sutton, J. Wilkinson (NM). I think we left the hut about 10 a.m. 
		The ridge gave pleasant climbing chiefly on sound rock, with two or three 
		pitches of IV. Great care is necessary in the zone which was shattered 
		by the earthquake. Comparable with the traverse of the Gds. Charmoz. Descent 
		by the same route without rappel enlivened by a squall of hail. After 
		a lazy day we were back by 5 p.m. Good assurance; no axe or crampons. 
		</P>
	  <H3>AIGUILLE NOIRE DE PEUTEREY, S. RIDGE. </H3>
	  <P>J. Hammond 
		(NM), G. J. Sutton, G. Dyke (NM), M. Ridges (NM). 5th/6th August. An attempt 
		a few days earlier was turned back on the &quot;deuxi&egrave;me tour.&quot; 
		Attack, I think, about 6 a.m. We suffered a good deal from thirst. Opinions 
		seem to differ, but this party felt that, climbing in a rucksack, the 
		standard rose occasionally to VS, and was seldom less than v. diff. The 
		rock is excellent and the assurance good. There are many bivouac sites 
		available. We wasted time by rappelling on baby nylon, which tangles abominably. 
		A very beautiful ridge, whether to look at or from. We bivouacked under 
		the summit at about 7.30 or 8.0 p.m. Of the descent the less said the 
		better: it is a ruin. No axe or crampons. Delicate rather than strenuous. 
		</P>
	  <H3>DENT DU CROCODILE, E. RIDGE. </H3>
	  <P>July 20th. 
		A. Blackshaw (OUMC), Hon. R. R. E. Chorley, G. J. Sutton. I think we left 
		Envers des Aiguilles about 4 a.m. It was the first ascent of the season, 
		and the bergschrunds were difficult. The lower part of the climb was in 
		bad condition, and the first chimney of V full of black ice: a fine lead 
		by Blackshaw. The two chimneys were thought to be just VS in normal good 
		conditions; the artificial pitch only Al; the rest never more and virtually 
		never less than severe, a very sustained 1,000 ft. or so, strenuous and 
		tiring in character. Our sacks were too comfortably garnished and so had 
		to be hauled up most of the hard pitches. This forced us to bivouac near 
		the summit. It would be far better and more enjoyable to gamble on travelling 
		light and fast enough to get down in the day. Descent by glacier to the 
		Requin hut. Crampons and one axe per corde&eacute;. Good assurance and 
		ample ledges. Little exposure. Stirrups and hammer.  </P>
	  <H3>DENT DU REQUIN, MAYER-DIBONA ROUTE. </H3>
	  <P>Hon. R. 
		R. E. Chorley, G. J. Sutton, E. D. G. Langmuir, J. Sims (NM). Our ascent 
		at the beginning of July was the first of the season. The climb was in 
		very bad condition. The penultimate diedre of IV was thought to contain 
		a pitch as hard as any on the S. ridge of the A. Noire de Peuterey. None 
		of the party had been on the mountain before; and an error in route-finding 
		on the way down, coupled with the condition of climbers and climb and 
		delay caused by the dropping of the rappel rope in the Fontaine Chimney, 
		caused the party to bivouac in an unfrequented corner of the mountain. 
		I have forgotten the date. Good rock, good assurance. Not sustained. Crampons 
		and one axe per cord&eacute;. </P>
	  <H3>AIGUILLE DE LA PERSEVERANCE, N.E. RIDGE. </H3>
	  <P>Hon. R. 
		R. E. Chorley, J. Lawton (NM), G. J. Sutton. Lac Blanc 1.30 p.m. Attack 
		perhaps 3 p.m. Summit 6 p.m. Lac Blanc again about 7 p.m. A very agreeable 
		climb, somewhat reminiscent of Longland’s, Suitable for unsettled weather. 
		It was thought to be somewhat overgraded: We went up to Planpraz on the 
		first telepherique from Chamonix, and walked back down to Chamonix after 
		the climb. I cannot remember the date. The walk from Planpraz to La Fleg&egrave;re 
		is so beautiful that we almost never got to the climb; perfect for a sunny 
		day of photography. Slightly loose rock. Moderate exposure, varying assurance. 
		</P>
	  <H3>POINTE ALBERT, W. FACE. </H3>
	  <P>August 13th. 
		G. J. Sutton, Miss E. Gregory. Attack about 7 a.m. We chose the traversing 
		start for speed. The climbing is exposed and strenuous, much of it on 
		pitons. Some of the stances are not of the best, but there is good security; 
		the rock varies. Summit about 130 p.m. One axe per corde&eacute;. Descent 
		short and easy. First ascent of an ED by a British lady. Stirrups, hammer. 
	  </P>
	  <H3>ZINAL ROTHORN – KANZELGRAT. </H3>
	  <P>A.B.C., 
		J.C.H.D., G.J.F., J. S. Huddart (ex-member). A natural route of great 
		charm and character on superb rock. It is short – about 700 ft. on the 
		Kanzelgrat proper – and leads directly almost to the summit. The hardest 
		part is only very difficult. It is highly recommended for the average 
		party, especially as it is little frequented. Our descent was by the Rothorngrat. 
		</P>
	  <H2>NOTES ON CLIMBING IN BALTSCHIEDERTAL </H2>
	  <P>The Baltschiedertal 
		runs north from Visp. It is practically uninhabited and comparatively 
		little visited, giving a sense of solitude and intimacy completely lacking 
		in larger Alpine climbing centres. The walk to the hut must be one of 
		the longest in the Alps, but can be enjoyable if it is taken easily. The 
		path is reasonable: one passes from the dusty heat of the Rh&ocirc;ne 
		Valley, through a beautifully wooded glen, and out onto the steep open 
		pastures; a final slog across moraine leads to the well situated Baltschiederklause. 
		</P>
	  <P>This really 
		provides a variety of excellent rock climbs of all standards. A.B.C., 
		J.C.H.D., G.J.F. and A. W. Pilborough (non- member) climbed the south-east 
		ridge of the S&uuml;dlicher Jagihorn, a short pleasant rock climb of no 
		particular difficulty, with the great merit of starting at the door of 
		the hut, and the south east ridge of the Bietschhorn. Roch describes this 
		ridge as &quot;une des plus belles escalades d’ar&ecirc;tes dans les Alpes.&quot; 
		The hardest part occurs towards the top of the initial &quot;big step&quot; 
		of some 300 ft., but it is nowhere more than mildly severe, even without 
		using any of the entirely superfluous pitons. There follow some interesting 
		gendarmes in a startling situation, until .html ridge is joined. It 
		seems quite simple to bypass the final part of this on the right, though 
		the more interesting, safer, but probably harder route keeps to the ridge 
		except for a mushroom gendarme which is easily turned on the right. We 
		did this. The rock,’ elsewhere rotten, is good on the ridge itself, though 
		there is loose material. We descended by the north ridge, mainly snow, 
		but still largely in good condition even in the afternoon, and enjoyable. 
		</P>
	  <P>Other rock 
		climbs in the valley that should be particularly worth while, though we 
		did not have time to attempt them, are the south ridge of the Stockhorn 
		and the &quot;Blanchetgrat&quot; on the L&ouml;tschentaler Breithorn. 
		The Nesthorn, the next mountain of the area after the Bietschhorn, has 
		its attractions also. All these climbs face south, which, combined with 
		the lower altitudes of the peaks, makes the Baltschiedertal a welcome 
		refuge from Zermatt in disappointing weather. </P>

	  <H2>THE DOLOMITES (1953). </H2>
	  <P>1. July 
		8th. Il Pollice (The Thumb) of the Cinque Dita (F&uuml;nffingerspitze): 
		R. O. Downes and J. P. Gaukroger. Much loose rock, but an enjoyable and 
		pure climb, of IV sup. We were on the rock 8 hours. </P>
	  <P>2. July 
		14th: Traverse of the three Vajolet Towers of Winkler, Stabeler and Delago, 
		with the small Piaz Tower for good measure. J.P.G. </P>
	  <P>The standard 
		route, but avoiding the Winkler crack by the easier, but exposed, right 
		hand wall Left Vajolet Hut 8.30. Back 6.30. The hard places, the Winkler 
		crack and variants and the Pichlriss crack are well pitoned and good security 
		was had by threading cords through them from the waist. Standard IV sup. 
		</P>
	  <P>(It was 
		quite the most enjoyable rock climb I have done – and the rock firm most 
		of the way). </P>
	  <P>3. July 
		16th: S.E. Pillar of the Sasso Pordoi. J.P.G. with guide Fabio Pederiva 
		(thought to be 4th ascent). </P>
	  <P>A delightful 
		&quot; outside edge&quot; climb not far from the road (at the Passo Pordoi, 
		on which British rock climbers would feel at home, the scale being that 
		of the bigger Welsh climbs. Standard V, with two pitches of VI. Four hours 
		without stops. </P>
	  <P>4. July 
		18th: Via Preuss on Delago Tower. Standard V on fine vertical line. </P>
	  <H2>GRITSTONE. </H2>
	  <P>Woodhouse 
		Scar, on N. side of Calder Valley, S.W. of Halifax. Steep, an outcrop 
		of the &quot;Rough Rock,&quot; which gives 20-30 very good lines mostly 
		S. to V.S., plus good and varied scrambling. Seven main buttresses of 
		30-40 feet, of which the right-hand one gives the best climbs. Well worth 
		an evening or two if seeking rocknastics in the vicinity. Grid. Ref. 44/083254.

	  </P>
	  <H2>ROSA PINNACLE OF CIR MHOR (SOUTH RIDGE), ARRAN. </H2>
	  <P>Deserves 
		to be better known by Sassenachs. A 900 ft. climb on superb rough granite. 
		The skin-sacrificing S crack is avoidable by a long groove on the right. 
		Pitch 9, less obviously avoidable, is perhaps Just VS. The details are 
		in the 1952 S.M.C. Guide. There is probably some scope for new routes 
		still, in Arran. </P>
