	  <P>JOE and 
		I met at the youth hostel at Visp in the Valais one Saturday evening. 
		Youth hostels make very good valley bases for a climbing holiday, which 
		is otherwise from mountain huts. On Sunday we took the train and bus up 
		to Saas-Grund, where we left a further instalment of heavy luggage before 
		setting off for the Weissmies H&uuml;tte. We were very disgruntled on 
		finding that, on the Swiss buses, luggage has to .be paid for as well. 
		Here I had my first taste of the somnolent atmosphere which reigns in 
		a hut from mid-afternoon until the evening. This, of course, consequent 
		upon the exertions of the morning. Living in an Alpine hut is a rapidly 
		acquired but definite art. There are the hut shoes to be sought for, found 
		and clumped about in; the shelf basket to be filled with all those heavyweight 
		foods which looked so attractive at the shop in the valley, and now, having 
		been carried so far, am beginning to regain their attraction; the knack 
		of sitting about watching others eat or talking, to be acquired � this 
		comes easily to the regular pub-goer; there is also the hut keeper to 
		be made friends with, so that he can be prevailed upon to bear with your 
		own particular cooking foibles. We attempted to go to bed early that night 
		� in the long sleeping shelves where everyone sleeps together. </P>
	  <P>Here a word 
		on our respective mountaineering experience. Joe had just finished a fortnight 
		with somewhat (I hope they don�t read this) experienced friends in the 
		Arolla District, and having &quot;done&quot; the Dent Blanche was feeling 
		confident, to put it mildly. He was also a rock-climbing leader of moderate 
		ability. I was quite definitely the second, although I had had a bit of 
		experience of rock and snow climbing in Britain. I can just imagine the 
		experienced Alpinist nodding his head wisely and saying, &quot;I thought 
		so,&quot; at this point. However I shall continue, as the purpose of this 
		article (if such an article can rather shyly raise its head, and say it 
		has a purpose) is to show how the fool can rush in and sometimes get away 
		with it. </P>
	  <P>It was therefore 
		not without some butterflies in the stomach that I for one lay down on 
		the shelf that night. I felt that I was committed to a somewhat audacious 
		(not to say foolhardy) enterprise and the adrenalin in my veins coupled 
		with the party singing Alpine songs downstairs ensured that I didn�t get 
		much sleep that night. This was a nervous feeling of anticipation that 
		I never learned quite to do without. In a sense, this is a part of the 
		thrill of climbing. </P>
	  <P>We awoke 
		and arose next morning at about 3 o�clock. Joe took a masochistic delight 
		in these early starts � &quot;one of the attractions of Alpinism&quot; 
		he used to say � evidently a case of one man�s meat. We used to try to 
		have an insular breakfast in the shape of a fried egg to supplement the 
		continental bread and jam. Off we set on the moraine path and this brings 
		me to one of the maxims of Alpinism � reconnoitre the route the night 
		before, especially if you have no glacier lantern. We evidently had not 
		done so sufficiently well and wasted a little time going round in small 
		circles. Finally we reached the glacier and roped up. One of the advantages 
		of being a novice is that you can still naively enjoy the simple pleasures 
		of Alpinism � roping up as the light dawns on the mountains. At first 
		the high snowy summits become a softly glowing red while the rest of the 
		silent world retains its sterile paleness. Slowly the glow creeps downwards 
		while you stamp your feet to warm them up � your crampon straps have been 
		done up too tightly. </P>
	  <P>We had a 
		guide book to the Valais Alps (in French) and consulting it, we set off 
		across the glacier. I should have said we were attempting to climb the 
		Weissmies by the ordinary route). Our uneasy autocracy of two led us too 
		far to the right on to some ice appearing terrifically steep to the Alpine 
		novice. This inspired him to drop his ice axe, which slid down to a little 
		crevice below. He was psychologically belayed by the cursing leader while 
		he crawled down to get it � it is awkward for a newcomer on crampons to 
		move on ice without an axe. Having retrieved it, the party moved off the 
		ice to some reassuring snow, and so along the correct route. The second 
		rather wished the leader wasn�t so fearless when he boldly went across 
		a steep snow slope with even steeper snow below it � he wished this because 
		he was expected to follow without a belay. The leader got rather peeved 
		if asked to belay the second on slopes of this nature. May I say here 
		how exposed I felt on steep snow slopes at first, something you get used 
		to in time, and something continental climbers seem very familiar with. 
		Finally we reached the top at 4023m. I tried to feel suitably thrilled 
		at climbing my first &quot;Viertausender,&quot; but my mind was wholly 
		filled with the thought of going down that steep slope again. </P>
	  <P>However, 
		once back at the hut we could practice climbsmanship with anyone who would 
		listen, lounge in the sun, attack our crampons with heavy stones (mine 
		didn�t quite fit), or merely sink into the warm pool of self-congratulation. 
		The wave of this carried us along the Fletschhorn-Laquinhorn traverse 
		the next day � &quot;a nice climb&quot; as one guide put it. I was introduced 
		to what I was told was typical Alpinism � a rock and snow ridge � I enjoyed 
		this except when being tugged impatiently along a snowy ar&ecirc;te with 
		steep drops on each side. Please don�t think my leader was a terribly 
		fierce person � I must apologise to him here and say how grateful I am 
		to him for putting up with such an obtuse and dithery second, whose only 
		questionable virtue is that he is alive to tell the tale. The guides put 
		up with us very well. We started after everyone else, used their tracks 
		until we overtook them, trying not to look proud of ourselves for a deplorable 
		breach of mountain manners, and took up all the space on the narrow summit 
		of the Laquinhorn, which we contrived to reach first. On the whole, we 
		used to feel a little sorry for the guides. One talked nostalgically with 
		us of the times he had been up a certain climb already that season just 
		taking party after party along it. I used to think they looked rather 
		enviously at us as we hurtled past. We were surprised to see how few parties 
		went guideless and rather arrogantly regarded ourselves as the &eacute;lite. 
		(This bubble was pricked later). On the whole the guides were never chary 
		of giving us advice and didn�t seem at all resentful � probably because 
		they were quite busy enough anyway, and we obviously (ex-W.D. anoraks) 
		had no money. </P>
	  <P>We came 
		on down to the valley the same day we left the top of the Laquinhorn � 
		this is customary. </P>
	  <P>Next day 
		at the Hotel in Saas-Grund reaction set in and I wondered at the enormity 
		of my offence in tempting fate so far as to presume to be an Alpinist. 
		&quot;Better leave it now and go home while your still in one piece,&quot; 
		said Prudence. Adventure squeaked from where he was being sat on by P., 
		&quot;The call of the high places.&quot; Finally Joe restored my self 
		confidence and we set off for the Britannia Hut above Saas Fee. Here we 
		met a guide who showed us we weren�t really the toughies we thought we 
		were � he would do a climb, go down to the valley, and then go <I>up</I> 
		to a hut the same day for .html climb on the following day. We went 
		suitably humbled to bed. Next day we traversed the Strahlhorn. I suppose 
		anything is bound to be a disappointment when it has been romantically 
		anticipated for a long while � such was my first view of the Matterhorn. 
		&quot;After all,&quot; I felt as I balanced precariously on the snowy 
		ar&ecirc;te, &quot;it�s only a heap of rock.&quot; It is, too. The afternoon 
		was given deplorably to peak-bagging � we bagged the Kleine Allalinhorn, 
		100 feet above the hut. </P>
	  <P>We reached 
		the high water mark of our rock-climbing on the next day. We traversed 
		the Rimpfischhorn &quot;avec Grand Gendarme.&quot; We abseiled at one 
		point on this and were suitably impressed when the guide and lady following 
		us presented us with the sling .that night in the hut. The rock was rough, 
		dry and sunny. I could shut my eyes and imagine myself in the Lake District 
		� but I won�t, as I might fall off. I very much enjoyed the airy secure 
		feeling of abseiling. Here a technical note. We only had one rope � being 
		poor men � and we unroped and abseiled on the climbing rope. (Is there 
		no limit to this fellow�s crimes against mountaineering? you say). Moving 
		together on the rope is something calculated to try any second�s patience 
		� its always his fault (really, no sarcasm intended) when the rope catches 
		or he stands on it. It needs much practice. </P>
	  <P>Next day 
		we distinguished ourselves by gallantly escorting a well-known lady Alpinist 
		and her young son to Zermatt over the Adler Pass. This was not quite so 
		chivalrous as it sounds, as she promised us a dinner in Zermatt if we 
		accompanied her. We didn�t do this too well, as we got slightly lost en 
		route. Big clean-ups that night in the Zermatt hostel preceded the appearance 
		of two scruffs at table in one of Zermatt�s hotels. In Zermatt we met 
		other C.U.M.C. members and swopped suitably impressive stories with one 
		.html. &quot;You should have seen the one that got away.&quot; Overheard 
		in Z. hostel (in a strong American ascent): &quot;I�d love to climb the 
		Matterhorn � it�s so romantic.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Off then 
		to the Betemps H&uuml;tte. This is the rendezvous of all the Swiss guideless 
		climbers � Monte Rosa being apparently considered the guideless &quot;must&quot; 
		in Switzerland. This we thought was beneath us, so we tried the Morshead 
		Buttress on Nordend � and failed. We were getting into the position where 
		&quot;we must go on because we can�t go back&quot; as the watchword, when 
		reason prevailed, we abseiled and laboriously retraced our steps. The 
		next day we &quot;did&quot; the Dufourspitze and ended up at the Margherita 
		Hut for the night. C.A.I. huts tend to be more racketeering than the standardised 
		Swiss Huts � however we finally got a small piece of bed space grudgingly 
		allotted to us. What with the inadequacy of the blankets, the crowding 
		and altitude sickness (a sort of depressing raging headache), the night 
		was unpleasant. The hut is at over 15,000 ft. The next day the Lyskamm, 
		Castor and Pollux were traversed. These were in an easy condition, but 
		even so it was a feat for such a party. We regarded ourselves with new 
		and respectful eyes when we saw a guide proceeding a cheval along the 
		snow ar&ecirc;te. I think I rose to the heights of mountain ecstacy when 
		we sat in the sun on top of Pollux and brewed tea. By now we had both 
		carelessly slipped on easy snow slopes, and had a new respect for our 
		partner�s ability to stop us. Going down some guides played a trick on 
		us by leading us up the garden path and then sitting down to let us overtake 
		them and find a route for ourselves. Needless to say we made a hash of 
		it and somewhat ignominiously rejoined their route. </P>
	  <P>Down again 
		to Z., where I gave much amusement to the lady hostel warden and her daughters 
		by patching the seat of my climbing breeches somewhat amateurishly. Next 
		day up to the Dom H&uuml;tte, and a climb in itself. We were suitably 
		impressed when a French schoolmarm convoyed a roped-up crowd of children 
		down past us. They were enjoying it very much. The climb to the hut was 
		our last, as bad weather curtailed our Alpine holiday, and we came down 
		from the hut two days later. The very tedious waiting at the hut was enlivened 
		by the hut-keeper�s little boy. </P>
	  <P>There is 
		something about anything which is first that is missing in the subsequent 
		ones � first love, first flowers of spring, first ascent, first excursion 
		into Alpinism. It is, I am sure, the childish, questioning unprejudiced 
		approach to it all; it is all new; wonder meets you at every turn; cynicism 
		and boredom belong to the later visits. �The fools rush in certainly, 
		but they probably enjoy themselves more than the worldly-wise angels. 
		Above all, make it a date for a visit to the Alps this summer if you haven�t 
		yet been, and I hope you have as good a time as we did. </P>
