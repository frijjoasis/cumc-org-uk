	  <H2>P. D. SMITH</H2>
	  <H3>King's</H3>
	  <P>PETER DRUMMOND 
		SMITH was a talented artist, a skilful pilot, and a fine mountaineer, 
		yet those of us who met him in one of these fields knew little or nothing 
		of his prowess in the others. Though he had many interests, and lived 
		a very full life, he was always self-effacing and talked little of his 
		own personal achievements. His enterprising spirit and his great courage, 
		are perhaps the best remembered of his many qualities. </P>
	  <P>While he 
		was up at King’s from 1948-51 he was one of the most active and fearless 
		members of the C.U.M.C., and when he went on to the Royal Academy to continue 
		his architectural studies, most of his free time was spent in the hills. 
		He was a beautifully balanced rock-climber, and an accomplished skier, 
		and had been devoting a great deal of his time before his death to improving 
		his knowledge of snow and ice conditions in Scotland and the Alps. It 
		is probable that a full account of his wanderings with David Monro during 
		their Easter visit to Scotland in 1952 would show that remarkable feats 
		were accomplished. </P>
	  <P>It was always 
		a joy to climb with him. He was quite imperturbable, and the quiet confidence 
		of a skilled leader was conveyed to the last man on his rope. If difficulties 
		arose, he was always thoughtful and unselfish, and could find the redeeming 
		feature in the most unpromising circumstances. We shall miss him in the 
		huts, on the slopes, and on the high ridges. </P>

	  <H2>D. H. MONRO</H2>
	  <H3>King’s</H3>
	  <P>DAVID HENRY 
		MONRO was born at Rooiberg, South Africa, on August 9th, 1926. </P>
	  <P>His early 
		years were a struggle against ill health, and as result of this he took 
		up athletics. At King’s College, Cambridge, he showed. great promise as 
		a half-miler, until the demands of training began to clash with his work; 
		so in 1947 he gave up running and joined the C.U.M.C., leaving his term 
		time clear for his studies. </P>
	  <P>Subsequently 
		his enthusiasm for the hills absorbed more and more of his life, so that 
		during the next five years he managed to spend a total of no lese than 
		nine months climbing. </P>
	  <P>Rock climbing 
		came to him easily – aided by his long reach and lean figure, but it was 
		on snow and ice, however, that he was at his best and happiest. He disliked 
		considering a route at length, preferring to set about it at once or leave 
		it alone. An accomplished photographer, he would wander over the hills 
		for hours with his camera. </P>
	  <P>I remember 
		vividly his affection for the Northern Highlands and his youthful and 
		burning enthusiasm when discussing his expeditions in the desolate country 
		around An Teallach which he regarded as his personal preserve. </P>
	  <P>In the bad 
		conditions that kept other climbers in the C.I.C. Hut on Ben Nevis on 
		1st April, David and Peter decided they must do something. It appeared 
		that they had completed South Castle fully and were descending easy ground 
		when they were overwhelmed by an avalanche. </P>
	  <P>David’s 
		tragic loss cut short an academic career full of promise. At the time 
		of his death he was Nuffield Research Scholar at Imperial College engaged 
		on work that would have brought him his B.Sc. this year. </P>
