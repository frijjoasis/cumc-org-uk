	  <P>I MET Roger 
		by mistake; and within two minutes of meeting he was showing me, rather 
		proudly, a suitcase full of colour photographs which he had taken anywhere 
		and everywhere in the States; snow and ice on Rainier, rock and colour 
		in the Tetons, sun and flowers from Florida. Several hours of this, then 
		lunch, almost an afterthought, and at last future climbing plans. Ten 
		days hence there was to be a Sierra Club meet, could I make it, he could 
		certainly wangle an invitation. But what about this weekend? Well, he 
		didn’t really know the area well, but he had been told about a smallish 
		outcrop north and east of Los Angeles; he was living in downtown L.A., 
		and I was out near Hollywood, so that sounded fine as a day’s outing to 
		try and get back into some kind of form. We duly met on Saturday and started 
		off in my humble car – my hosts were thrilled to have Roger’s Rolls parked 
		outside their house all day! After a good deal of misdirecting from the 
		navigator we at last reached the promised land: a semi-desert area, just 
		off the main road, ankle deep in ice cream papers and garbage. Not unlike 
		a race-course after the races are over, but hotter, dustier, dirtier. 
		</P>
	  <P>Parked the 
		’tar under the only tree, it was terribly hot; changed and set off, jingling 
		our pitons to give us confidence. We looked with doubt and apprehension 
		towards the rock; it was hardly inviting. Uniformly high, about fifty 
		feet, save at the east end, sort of a circular island, broken here and 
		there, some horrid looking cracks, mostly overhanging, and some worse 
		looking walls. The rock was a sort of rough sandstoney texture, but not 
		too rounded; a geologist tells me it must have been a kind of granite, 
		but perhaps he’s only guessing. The rock in the sun was incredibly hot, 
		it burnt the feet painfully, one could hardly touch it; and Roger said 
		some- thing about poisonous snakes hereabouts to add to our discomfort. 
		We walked around the island, expecting to find something climbable around 
		each corner. After one circuit we had found several &quot;might go’s,&quot; 
		but all in the sun – quite out of the question. Roger thought a steep 
		looking groove in the shadow might go, he got up about six feet, spent 
		five minutes telling me how unfit he was and .html. five convincing 
		himself he couldn’t make it, and came down; I tried, got no further, but 
		didn’t need quite so much convincing. Eventually we got into a huge curving 
		chimney right inside the island, got up some fifteen feet, didn’t like 
		it, not any holds, and too wide at the top for back and foot, anyway it 
		was so painful in a thin shirt, more half-hearted attempts getting nowhere 
		at all, and then without much argument we convinced ourselves that it 
		was lunch time. I don’t know who made the suggestion, perhaps it can be 
		blamed on the ice cream, anyway we decided to forget about climbing and 
		find the sea – sorry, the ocean. We did, a few miles south of point Mugu, 
		and after a descent down a red mud bank much too high and loose, more 
		exacting than anything in the morning, a swim in the breakers. We consoled 
		ourselves with the thought that the rock had been horrid, hot, even unclimbable, 
		and who knows, we might have been at the wrong place – though in our hearts 
		we knew that we lied. So our first day’s climbing together. </P>
	  <P>Our second 
		day’s climbing was not unlike the first; only on Sunday we skipped the 
		climbing preliminaries and went straight to our beach (some compensation, 
		it was probably the only one a hundred miles either way completely deserted). 
		But next Sunday would be the real thing; or so Roger told me. </P>
	  <P>We started 
		off very early, drove for an hour or so, mostly along eight-lane freeways 
		(why doesn’t England have these?), had break- fast in a drive-in, and 
		met the boys, or, more properly, the Rock Climbing Section of The Sierra 
		Club. Most of them seemed to pride themselves on bone-crushing handshakes; 
		that and the hardware stock they carried around impressed me most. Another 
		two hours driving, higher and higher into the Sierras, brought us to the 
		charred remains of a great forest. A few minutes walk, more shaking of 
		ironmongery, but this time depressing, there was so much about, and we 
		were there. &quot;There&quot; was a series of cliffs, mostly small, say 
		twenty to a hundred and sixty feet high, the same kind of rock as on our 
		ill-fated island, nice for pitons, a few holds, but awfully steep. </P>
	  <P>There seemed 
		to be rather a lot of competition among the younger generation of the 
		Sierra climbers; some had driven that morning all the way from San Diego 
		– about two hundred miles of pre-breakfast driving. There was a lot of 
		talk of nightly gymnastics, a &quot;work-out,&quot; of a terrifying number, 
		well into three figures, of press-ups and pull-ups non-stop. Almost at 
		once one of the tigers started up one of the overhanging walls, climbing 
		entirely on artificial aid; he carried enough ironmongery to make a hardware 
		store jealous, all making a depressing noise; I hoped I wouldn’t be asked 
		to follow anything like that – imagine taking out all those pitons. We 
		were led around the corner, after a suitable photographic interval, and 
		told, indirectly I guess, by our instructor that &quot;the English just 
		ain’t safe.&quot; After a few minutes of showing us the fundamentals, 
		together with a lot that wasn’t obvious to unsafe climbers (such as the 
		fact that it was really quite unjustifiable to lead out more than about 
		ten feet without sticking in a pin, if one wasn’t sure of what was coming), 
		we were led off’ to be shown &quot;dynamic tension,&quot; a new way of 
		belaying. I envisaged’ pulleys, pitons by the dozen, and goodness knows 
		what; it turned out to be merely having the rope around one’s waist instead 
		of over one’s shoulder. Now we were to do some &quot;practical &quot;; 
		jumping off. I saw us innocents commending ourselves to the powers,. jumping 
		off the top (now it looked quite high), and waiting for the jerk rather 
		like a parachutist. I was soon relieved; the cliff was only fifteen feet 
		high just here, and jumping off meant climbing up a few feet, and then 
		falling, on the rope of course. This dynamic tension business looked simplicity 
		itself; I was the first guinea pig, put the rope around my waist carefully, 
		took a stance, firm I thought, felt a ton or so of bricks at the other 
		end, and was dragged ignominiously across the rock. Only after several 
		attempts did I hold the faller, whom I suspected of cheating by not allowing 
		me to take the rope in and so falling several feet before allowing the 
		strain to come on the rope (one shudders when one thinks of the countless 
		times one has cheerfully reassured one’s partner with &quot;wonderful 
		stance &quot; and &quot;perfect belay&quot; as he was about to lead’ through 
		on a Welsh crag). A few more instructions on the American. (or Californian, 
		rather, there is a difference) way of doing this or that before we were 
		released. </P>
	  <P>Perhaps 
		most important was the verbal procedure. None of this &quot;Okay, come 
		on&quot; business; this was serious work. The code was; something like 
		this; the leader reaches his stance, belays, and when ready to bring up 
		the second shouts down &quot;belay on&quot; (nothing else will do – even 
		&quot;on belay&quot; is sacrilege); the second re-echoes his call, and 
		when ready to climb announces &quot;climbing &quot;; the leader now commands 
		&quot;climb.&quot; During the climb itself there is; none of the &quot; 
		take up the rope, damn you,&quot; or &quot;slack, slack, you’re throttling 
		me, you idiot &quot;; only the cries of &quot; up rope &quot; and &quot;slack&quot; 
		are permissible. Several times Roger said &quot;rope up&quot; and was 
		severely reprimanded for his heresy; and all this with a dead straight 
		face! </P>
	  <P>By now the 
		rocks, and they were fairly extensive, were not unlike Brighton beach 
		on a Bank Holiday. Grandfathers who had climbed in the Golden Age, whenever 
		that was, elderly men starting for the first time, boys and kids, beginners 
		and experts, mothers with children and even babies, people everywhere. 
		And the noise; &quot; up rope,&quot; &quot;falling,&quot; &quot;belay 
		on,&quot; &quot;climbing,&quot; &quot;slack,&quot; all jumbled up, a terrible 
		racket; but worse the incessant banging of the pitons - bedlam. </P>
	  <P>Lunch, and 
		after we had watched the best of the West Coast climbers, Royal Robins, 
		piton his way over a horrible looking overhang (he looked terribly good), 
		we were led to .html climb. Two ropes, our instructor on the business 
		end of the first, his helper of the second, I was second, Roger last. 
		Poor Roger; his was the work. Our leader used only seven pegs in the 130 
		feet, conservative really, it was about a V. Diff. Actually that is unfair; 
		where we might have put a sling he put a peg, only rather more often. 
		But the time taken! Roger spent fifteen minutes with one peg before the 
		rock would surrender its violator. However we had completed a climb; our 
		consciences were stayed. We scrambled back along the ridge to a sort of 
		amphitheatre where the practice climbs pure and simple were done; the 
		wall was perhaps twenty feet high. </P>
	  <P>Four or 
		five distinct routes, some hard, some harder; the tigerish competitors 
		swarmed up and sometimes off, amid the usual laid-down cries. Top ropes 
		so no pitons; not unlike Harrisons just here save for the noise. Roger, 
		after a good deal of verbal pushing, at last did the easiest to relieve 
		my conscience. </P>
	  <P>The last 
		innovation I saw was a further employment of artificial aid. Someone wanted 
		to climb a wall; but no holds, and worse, no cracks – I would have said 
		leave well alone, perhaps it was not meant to be climbed; but I was told 
		that that was of course sentimental rubbish – if a wall is there and one 
		wants to climb it, one climbs it. And so the lengthy business of expanding 
		bolts. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes to drill a hole in the rock, 
		and perhaps .html five to insert what looked to me not unlike a rawlplug. 
		I thought what would happen if these enthusiasts, who would spend a day 
		pegging and plugging their way up a wall, were let loose in Wales – and 
		shuddered. </P>
	  <P>But the 
		day was over, the smog was rolling up even into the hills, it was time 
		to go. Maybe we hadn’t done much, maybe we were armchair climbers after 
		all – but we had certainly seen and learnt a lot. More bone-crushing handshakes, 
		and we were off. I must confess that later I got to know these hills and 
		the methods of their climbers a little better; but the first impressions 
		were peculiar. Perhaps pitons scattered over a cliff do make the climbing 
		of it safer; but at the same time something seems to be lost – and do 
		we want to see Llanberis and Langdale transformed into a hardware store? 
		</P>
	  <P>These west 
		coast climbers were certainly boundless in their enthusiasm, and their 
		kindness. Certes any English climber who goes to the States is assured 
		of a wonderful welcome from the American climbing fraternity – I can vouch 
		for those west of the Mississippi. The &quot;nothing-is-too-much-trouble 
		&quot; and &quot;do-come- along-with-us&quot; attitude prevails everywhere. 
		The Americans are wonderful hosts. And if their climbing methods are not 
		ours, let the English climber remember that &quot;he just ain’t safe.&quot; 
		</P>
	  <P>So these 
		then were the Sierras – well, gee. </P>
