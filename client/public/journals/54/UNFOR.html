	  <P>TOO often 
		the climber dances to the guide-book’s tune and the day becomes an inexorable 
		progression from pitch to pitch. So that on our first visit to Clogwyn 
		du’r Arddu it seemed right that the day should be memorably enlivened 
		by divers strange and diabolical incidents. The proper introduction to 
		the cliff was rumoured to be Longland’s, which made one good argument 
		against the idea. Something about the same standard and half as long again 
		drew us, with a sneaking feeling of presumption, up the Western Terrace, 
		where the Great Slab entry ought to be. </P>
	  <P>Access to 
		a main groove and the grass Caterpillar is made via a short slab which 
		is traversed low, then crossed diagonally up to the left. Jim belayed 
		while I started off, exploratory-like, in socks, on to the slab, then 
		at once the holds faded. A promising pinch- hold was carefully dried with 
		a handkerchief, improving it from the wet to the merely slimy. Various 
		combinations of knight’s moves followed, and failed. The book said something 
		about &quot;reach an asset here.&quot; &quot;Stupid remark when there’s 
		nothing to reach for.&quot; Jim joined the fray and the next quarter of 
		an hour was spent roaming over his head and shoulders, working up hate 
		for that slab. During a rare sally on to the rock, and for exercise rather 
		than in hope, I tried going straight up a few feet to the top of the slab 
		where it met a minor overhang. The holds soon petered out again on the 
		left, but they held the germ of an idea, an idea quite as dastardly in 
		concept as that of Morley Wood’s inserted chockstones. One flaky hold 
		took line: by threading the rope through a sling and pulling on the double 
		rope, one might swing across far enough to reach definite holds. Besides, 
		surely other people didn’t take forty minutes over this move’? </P>
	  <P>It worked, 
		of course, though hardly part of the British repertory, and Great Slab 
		appeared to suffer the insult without reproach on that pitch. At eighty 
		feet there was a spike graced with a stance of the glorious-out-of-balance 
		kind. It seemed simpler and more traditional to leave a running belay 
		and take out the full hundred and thirty feet. It must remain a trade 
		secret how this pitch was done on a 120 ft. rope; but then nylon is strangely 
		elastic stuff. Presumably it was the reaction of the mind to the initial 
		delay which persuaded such an unreasonable decision. But we still thought 
		that the best answer would be not to stop, but to take a longer rope. 
		At the top was the cave – a typical Clogwyn grotto, miniature, but very 
		hospitable. Jim, in rope-soles, appeared to float up, laden with my boots, 
		unable to use the rope swing, and actually tugged back by the action of 
		the initial runner. We looked up at the sweep of Bow-Shaped Slab above, 
		looked away again, and Jim smoked a cigarette. At that point we noticed 
		the creature that was to give us so much enjoyment; on the far side of 
		the llyn, a quarter of a mile away and below, a pair ol gangling human 
		legs lay stretched out beside a boulder, with no sign of the parent body. 
		Then mist floated across the cwm, hiding this impressive Spartan from 
		us. </P>
	  <P>Afterwards, 
		one could reflect how individual each pitch had been. The first for length 
		and time, averaging just two minutes for each yard. The next was remarkable 
		for its stance. Round the corner from the cave one went easily up the 
		edge to a superb position on the slab, both feet squashed on a sod with 
		a high frequency oscillation. Cloud had swirled down on the cliff, and 
		from this unique anchorage one may savour to the full the bracing air 
		of the valley – at least until the second arrives to elbow you off. The 
		traverse across to the pastures didn’t seem too difficult; more of an 
		exercise in jockeying oneself into position, but the pitch was made memorable 
		by the move up on to the Field. The exploring hand entered a burrow-like 
		cavity, squeezed through topsoil and subsoil and mud to reach and pull 
		up on a knob of rock some fifteen inches down the hole. A fine, rabbity, 
		route-finding move on a typically interesting Menlove pitch. We breasted 
		the furrows to find an enormous flake belay from which someone had thoughtfully 
		chipped away the sharp edge at one point. </P>
	  <P>The abominable 
		yeti now seemed to be somewhere below on the screes, for the air was suddenly 
		alive with whistling. We couldn’t signify that we had heard as there was 
		no loose rock within reach, so turned to the last major difficulty, the 
		little forty foot corner. The slab continues up, at a fairly easy angle, 
		with the corner on the right formed by the wall of Central Rib. At twenty 
		feet the wall bulges to the left, pushing one out on to the slab. And, 
		as ever apparently, oozing with water. OE came the boots again. Fifteen 
		up a spike on the right wall took a runner: then a curious leftward move 
		on to a flake, first for a hand, then as foothold. This is painful for 
		stockings, fortunately, so one isn’t enjoined to dally before lunging 
		for a few quartz excrescences. The carpet-roll grass is sorely missed 
		here, but at this point the bulge of the right wall lies back and the 
		corner turns into an easy groove, where all those with any sense of gratitude 
		will jam with thanks. In this position, soaking up water like a piece 
		of damp blotting-paper, I supposed only my nether reaches were visible 
		from below, for these horrifying sounds smote the silence: </P>
	  <P>&quot;Are 
		you laybacking?&quot; &quot; NO!&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;What’s 
		it like – desperate?&quot; &quot;H’m... rather.&quot; </P>
	  <P>With a few 
		such terse, well-chosen phrases, etc. But it was a poor effort; any wide 
		awake leader, thinking entirely of his second, would have risen to the 
		occasion and returned quite different answers to such inquiries. Jim came 
		up again like the proverbial bomb, though some low growls did rumble up 
		from below the bulge. However, we were to be spared nothing; for a shout, 
		thin but plaintive, floated up to us: &quot;Where are you going?&quot; 
		It was a remarkable example of curiosity under trying conditions, yet 
		it drew from us not an intelligent reply, but hysterical laughter which 
		put further climbing out of the question for some minutes. Who was this 
		fearless denizen of the cwm? A humorous peasant, possibly a lonely scion 
		of the Headlongs, or a mere Llanberis tribesman? The truth will never 
		be known, for after that single wild cry the creature was neither seen 
		nor heard again. </P>
	  <P>Now the 
		guide-book got quite blas&eacute;; &quot;280 ft. The difficulty is now 
		over. Beautiful slab climbing in fine position.&quot; Yet it felt only 
		then that we were on Great Slab at last, with its impressive width and 
		sweep. Photographs seem to belie the scale of the cliff, perhaps because, 
		taken from a distance it is difficult to introduce any object of comparison. 
		Despite what one says when on it, it is a magnificent face, and beautiful 
		in form; the lines of both but- tresses are asymmetrical, yet perfect 
		in balance, their length accentuated by each one’s single characteristic 
		of fierceness or grandeur. </P>
	  <P>A lot of 
		rope would be useful on these last pitches to avoid long searches for 
		belays. One can only speculate on what future generations will use when 
		the quartz spillikins and grass tufts have gone. ’Then, abruptly, we were 
		up, peering on to the top of Narrow, and to increase our delight, with 
		the sun breaking through a lifting cloudbank. Beyond the summit, in the 
		west, Quellyn and the smaller lakes gleamed, burnished to silver in the 
		evening light: a finale to match the day. </P>
