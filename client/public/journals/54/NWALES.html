	  <P>IT was all 
		somehow inevitable. The evening was mild and moonlit, the weather showed 
		no signs of breaking. We had had but a short day’s climbing and only one 
		more day remained of the Christmas meet. I for one had an urge to enjoy 
		the luxurious feeling that there would be no more of the tension of climbing 
		this time. Once someone had suggested that he walk the fourteen ’three 
		thousands&quot; it would have been hard to have stayed behind. </P>
	  <P>No amount 
		of exhortation seemed to stir the others – &quot;finished and finite clods, 
		untroubled by a spark&quot;; one had indigestion, others thought it a 
		good idea for later, and some had a date with Bochlwyd Buttress. So just 
		before 10 o’clock Trevor and I set out from Glandena, hoping to walk the 
		six Carnedds in time for an early breakfast back at the hut. The night 
		was almost oppressively warm as we tramped up the flanks of Pen yr Oleu-wen 
		above Llyn Ogwen. Even stripped down to my shirt I sweated hard until 
		we broke onto the eastern ridge and a small cool wind breathed across 
		the deep black pool of the curn above Ffynnon Lloer. The moon, with only 
		one day to wax, shone strongly through a patchy mackerel sky, flooding 
		spires and peaks with silver light and leaving valleys in deep, seemingly 
		bottomless shadow. Once we were on the cairn of Pen yr Oleu-wen we could 
		see dearly the long ridge running along and up to Carnedd Llewellyn, the 
		patterns of Bethesda’s and Bangor’s lights below, and all Anglesey laid 
		out like a map beyond to the south Snowdon stood out, a dark and distant 
		shape against the sky. </P>
	  <P>We followed 
		the ridge, feeling trespassers in this still, mysterious world. We almost 
		felt we had to whisper. A fine walk over Carnedd Dafydd and then we followed 
		the rough path up the vast swell of Llewellyn. There we had to strike 
		down off our main line towards Yr Elen, which appeared deceptively close 
		in the moonlight, perhaps its craggy silhouette struck the mind after 
		the flowing rhythm of the other Carnedds. We stumbled down over loose 
		rock and then retraced our steps at length and cut an irritating traverse 
		across small stones to avoid Llewellyn. After Yr Elen the last two peaks, 
		Foel Grach and Foel Fras, were heaves on a wide rounded ridge. It was 
		a long dull trudge enlivened only by the occasional bog and then the appearance 
		of four still figures in sharp shadow against the sky; which, upon tentative 
		inspection, proved to be only large slates supporting a wire fence. At 
		last on Foel Fras we rested in the curious wilderness of small stones, 
		observed the sea and set off to return almost the way we had come. </P>
	  <P>When we 
		finally came to Craig Llugwy, between Llewellyn and Dafydd, our labours 
		were rewarded by a strange sight. Tryfan had changed. Almost inevitably 
		Tryfan has a place of honour in my mountain mythology; it is more than 
		a mountain, a sort of pagan altar, a primeval place rooted in the past. 
		Now it was showing its other self, that part of its personality repressed 
		in the day and only visible by the moon. For Tryfan was standing alone 
		as a dwarfed shadow, sharp, black, incongruous, a foreign eminence wandered 
		from some underworld into a strange, silver universe. Towards this sinister 
		presence we ran and stumbled beside a restless stream until, just before 
		five, we reached the hut. </P>
	  <P>An hour 
		and a half of cooking and eating, and we set off again, now up the familiar 
		slopes of the north ridge of Tryfan. It was that melancholy, desperate 
		hour before dawn and colder than before. I knew my full stomach would 
		pay dividends eventually, but at the time it was an embarrassment, while 
		Trevor was really in pain. As at last we reached Adam and Eve a slow dawn 
		spread a lurid red gash under an ugly black lid of cloud. But fresh hope 
		and energy came with the slight sun and we tackled Bristly Ridge and walked 
		over the Glyders, perhaps the most exhilarating part of the whole day. 
		By the time we reached the top of the Devil’s Kitchen it was clear that 
		my advice to Trevor to eat until he felt sick had worked out too literally. 
		He was not at all well, but he managed to make his way back to Glandena. 
		</P>
	  <P>It was now 
		getting on for 11 o’clock, and I was determined to finish before dark 
		if I could, so I struck up to Y Garn, the tenth peak and then down through 
		a slope of sheep to the wide circuit ridge of the Afon Dudodyn valley. 
		After a struggle up to Elidir Fawr it was a long slanting run down over 
		shale and grass towards Nant Peris, leaving the ungainly geometry of the 
		Dinorwic slate mines to the right. Walls, animals, house, a track and 
		then the road; a depressing walk up the valley past respectable Welshmen 
		(it was Sunday) and smells of cooking. </P>
	  <P>Having no 
		clear idea of good routes for Snowdon I made up Cwm Glas. This part seemed 
		long, and there was a great deal of loose scree. At last, breaking up 
		to the right of the Cwm, I found the railway. There was a strong cross 
		wind, and I was stopping more often now. When I finally reached the summit 
		it was covered in cloud and sprinkled with Boy Scouts. Only two peaks 
		remained. &quot;You will know Crib Goch by the trig. point,&quot; said 
		the Boy Scouts. But when I had stumbled over Crib y Ddisgl and was floundering 
		over the towers of Crib Goch I could not find one. The cloud was thicker 
		and the successive crests seemed higher and higher. On the last tower, 
		having drawn a blank, I looked back and it seemed as I looked that I had 
		missed the highest point, and the mythical trig point with it. But it 
		was now 4 o’clock, so in angry frustration I ate the piece of William’s 
		coconut ice that I had been saving up for the fourteenth peak and was 
		surprised how little there was. The irritation of having, as I supposed, 
		missed the summit of Crib Goch, of being too tired to go back, and of 
		having to hurry down before it was dark, overwhelmed everything. The loose 
		scree running out over small rock outcrops was almost the last straw, 
		and I missed the Pig track and ended up with dusk on the track beside 
		Llyn Ilydaw. The curling walk down to Pen-y-Pass was curiously lighthearted 
		and detached; rocks and shadows seemed to be people and animals, motionless 
		and waiting under the full moon. </P>
	  <P>A lift took 
		me down to the P-y-G where illicit temptation was just resisted; and then, 
		halfway to Capel, a Good Samaritan picked me up, fed me sandwiches and 
		took me right round to Glandena to one of William’s good meals, and bed. 
		It was a providential end to a most rewarding walk under almost perfect 
		conditions. I hope others, not wholly obsessed with motor cars or the 
		Munich, will try it and enjoy it as much as I did. </P>
