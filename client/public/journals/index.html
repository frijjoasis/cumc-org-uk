<!-- This sets up the top level navigation stuff. The <div> bits are to allow the layout to be different from other links on the page (layout info in the stylesheet) //-->
<!-- The "secondary-header" stuff is for those pages which have a second level of navigation in them - most pages linked to by the top level navigation bar are sections which have sub-pages within that section, so this list can be used to display links to the sub-pages //-->

<h1>Journals</h1><hr><h2>the club through the ages</h2>
<!-- To maintain continuity, use <h1> tage for the main heading for each page, with a <hr> tag underneath it. If a second heading is required underneath the line, use <h2>. If not, use a <br> to space the line away from the start of the general text - not needed if there is a h2 heading. 
For subheadings further down the page, <h1> and a <hr><br> are probably the most appropriate //-->

<P>Journals 
		were first published by the Alpine Club in 1863. Cambridge started publishing 
		a joint journal with Oxford in 1921. Entitiled 'Oxford and Cambridge Mountaineering' 
		it was a short lived affair, soon to be replaced by a slimmer volume 'Cambridge 
		Mountaineering'. This was first published in 1926 and has been published 
		most years hence. The real copies of the Journal are kept in the Wherry 
		Library at Pembroke.</P>
	  <P>Currently 
		only few journals are fully online, each decade being represented.
            No attempt has been made yet to catalogue the articles. Once there are a sizeable 
		number of articles, an attempt will be made to make a browsable index. 
		At the moment you'll just have to follow your nose although we would strongly 
		recommend most of the articles in the 1926 Journal purely for historical 
		reasons. Some articles have not been scanned in. These are mainly accounts 
		of club meets and the such like, whilst interesting, would take up valuable 
		space. If you would like to read of these accounts, or to browse through the other issues of the journal, you should 
            contact the <a href="../about_us/committee.html">Wherry Librarian</a>.</P>
