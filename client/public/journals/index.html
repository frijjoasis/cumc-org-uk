<h1>Journals</h1><hr><h2>the club through the ages</h2>


<P>Journals 
		were first published by the Alpine Club in 1863. Cambridge started publishing 
		a joint journal with Oxford in 1921. Entitiled 'Oxford and Cambridge Mountaineering' 
		it was a short lived affair, soon to be replaced by a slimmer volume 'Cambridge 
		Mountaineering'. This was first published in 1926 and has been published 
		most years hence. The real copies of the Journal are kept in the Wherry 
		Library at Pembroke.</P>
	  <P>Currently 
		only few journals are fully online, each decade being represented.
            No attempt has been made yet to catalogue the articles. Once there are a sizeable 
		number of articles, an attempt will be made to make a browsable index. 
		At the moment you'll just have to follow your nose although we would strongly 
		recommend most of the articles in the 1926 Journal purely for historical 
		reasons. Some articles have not been scanned in. These are mainly accounts 
		of club meets and the such like, whilst interesting, would take up valuable 
		space. If you would like to read of these accounts, or to browse through the other issues of the journal, you should 
            contact the <a href="../about/committee">Wherry Librarian</a>.</P>
