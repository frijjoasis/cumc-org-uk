	  <P>WELL, as 
		I remember it, Phil was downtown and I was noshing this amazingly gruesome 
		Camembert and getting traces of it on all the best pages in the guidebook. 
		I like guidebooks – know all the routes back to front – but you’re not 
		supposed to ask how many I’ve done. And my maps, too, are impressively 
		torn considering how rarely they’ve been opened above the ale-line. </P>
	  <P>The day 
		before we’d spent many happy hours on the Obergabelhorn and had returned 
		older, wiser, and knowing one thing for sure – that snow and ice routes 
		just weren’t in condition. So it was the rock routes I was pondering as 
		I lay there in the sun, and soon my thoughts turned to the Weisshorn, 
		an old score. Of course, thought I, the Schaligrat faces south – shouldn’t 
		be too bad – and after that the snow should have disappeared from the 
		Zmutt... </P>
	  <P>The Bahnhof 
		next morning was all hustle and bustle. No time to buy tickets – a train 
		was just leaving. So we ploughed our way through a sea of flower-bedecked 
		paunches, leapt aboard, and slammed the door on that unique mixture of 
		German gutterals and American drawls that is Zermatt. </P>
	  <P>Now Randa 
		is only two stops, so we reckoned on a free ride with any luck. But just 
		as the village came into sight a door slid back and in strode this individual 
		with a threatening tool clutched in his hand. </P>
	  <P>&quot;No 
		tickets! Where do you go?&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Randa.&quot; 
		</P>
	  <P>&quot;Randa 
		not good. Next stop St. Niklaus.&quot; </P>
	  <P>The dismayed 
		silence was broken only by the rattle of the train. Then Phil started 
		asking if we could get back from St. Niklaus without extra charge, but 
		having bitter experience of the Swiss I was summing astronomical figures 
		to see how much we were going to be out of pocket. </P>
	  <P>The collector. 
		however, was grappling with the door. &quot;Quick!&quot; he urged – francs 
		changed hands rapidly and then we jumped. drawing amazed looks from other 
		passengers. The train had stopped at a signal outside Randa – a lucky 
		break. </P>
	  <P>Up and up 
		and up we went but the Taschhorn and Dom went up faster; the sun was high 
		enough up already and just beamed down on us, hot and sticky. Phil’s secret 
		hoard of Dextrosol must have taken a beating that day, because he was 
		really moving. Floundering along behind, I just cursed and cursed and 
		sweated gallon after gallon. </P>
	  <P>Well, at 
		last the hut was reached; we brewed up and spent an hour or so chewing 
		schwarzbrot. You could die of exhaustion eating that stuff, but it does 
		keep (some people use the same loaf two seasons running). Anyway, stomachs 
		satisfied, we went up to the glacier and took a look at the route to the 
		Schalijoch. We didn’t like what we saw – one could get really lost trying 
		to find a way through that choss in the dark. </P>
	  <P>Evening, 
		and the oil lamp flickered around the cosy hut. Our prayers had been answered: 
		across the table an old guide was attacking a huge steak like a grizzly 
		bear. He had apparently done the route over twenty times, so we were feeling 
		far more confident – the tricky routefinding to the Schalijoch would be 
		no problem now. On our left were his clients, two stalwarts of the L.A.C. 
		fresh from an icy ascent of the Peuterey. We were quite impressed and 
		tried not to eat our spaghetti in too revolting a manner. </P>
	  <P>At 1.30 
		the next morning a long string of lights wound its way across the n&eacute;v&eacute;s 
		and onto the lowest bay of the Schali glacier – no less than three guided 
		parties now, if you please, and there at the end Phil and myself trying 
		to assume an air of independence... </P>
	  <P>&quot;Don’t 
		they go slowly!&quot; whispers Phil. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Yes,&quot; 
		I grunt, but my attention is focused on the Schalihorn where I can just 
		discern a lurking cloud – an unhealthy sign as the sky was clear earlier. 
		</P>
	  <P>Suddenly 
		the guided parties stop. To maintain a discreet distance we are forced 
		to do the same. What can be happening – surely they aren’t turning back 
		already? It is some time before we realise that they are merely roping 
		up. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		hints of dawn And us strapping on crampons at the top of the 700 ft. rock 
		wall which separates the central and upper bay of the glacier. Here the 
		rock crumbles away like gravel beneath your boots, and safety considerations 
		force the little procession of parties to close right up. </P>
	  <P>It is not 
		a good dawn. I look round at the grey light and shredded clouds and shiver 
		apprehensively. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Now 
		young men.&quot; the old guide interrupts my thoughts, &quot;would you 
		like to go ahead for a while?&quot; </P>
	  <P>I can see 
		us forging ahead into the cloud, never to be seen again like Mallory and 
		Irvine. Not being a hero. I delay the decision by asking &quot;How do 
		you like the weather?&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;At 
		the moment it does not look good.&quot; comes the reply, &quot;but we 
		can lose nothing by going to the Schalijoch.&quot; </P>
	  <P>I shrug 
		my shoulders and we start up the glacier. </P>
	  <P>And so at 
		last we reached the joch, finding the final approach across slopes of 
		steep rubble extremely trying. Shortly after six o’clock we left the other 
		parties eating their second breakfasts and started up the ridge. We had 
		just climbed the first and most difficult step when suddenly the clouds 
		rolled back and we could see tower after tower of red rock rising before 
		us, light clouds tugging at their narrow crests. And although the ridge 
		was barely started, the position was already tremendous. </P>
	  <P>The climbing 
		was interesting, but nowhere difficult. The sheer length of the ridge, 
		however. was astounding. I think we were drugged by it all, aware of nothing 
		but the immediate problems of. the climbing and the need to keep moving. 
		I have impressions of firm sun-warmed rock, all reds and yellows, of sunshine 
		and still air, and of a sort of machine-like motion through all this, 
		moving together mostly but snapping on belays for the steeper sections. 
		And behind us the serrated edge fell away, ever lengthening. </P>
	  <P>On the last 
		section of the ridge we enter the cloud again and the atmosphere is more 
		forbidding. The guidebook speaks of five gendarmes before the summit, 
		but we must have climbed at least seven or eight and still they keep coming, 
		weird shapes looming through the mist: each time we pray it will be the 
		top. Then I clamber up a little rocky corner and we are there. It is a 
		great relief – with only one short rest in over four hours it has become 
		a definite effort to keep going. The time is 10.30, our time from the 
		but nine hours. </P>
	  <P>Four thousand 
		five hundred metres and you can’t see a thing! All that exist in the world 
		are two people, a cone of snow, and a thick mist. It is remarkably still; 
		no sound and not a breath of wind. Summit photos show figures floating 
		in a veil of white. We spend an hour on the summit and the only other 
		party to arrive is from the East ridge. We feel quite pleased, but we’ve 
		yet to descend. </P>
	  <P>You know, 
		we were quite right about these snow routes – they just aren’t in condition. 
		Take this East ridge for example; on the more level sections the snow 
		is soft and knee deep, and here where it’s quite steep there’s just ice 
		covered by a layer of tinkling ice granules. We’ve been descending on 
		our front points for several hundred feet now, tiring on the ankles but 
		the only way to get a safe purchase. When I look between my stabbing feet 
		I can see Phil some twenty feet below kicking rhythmically. Make those 
		points bite. boy! </P>
	  <P>The snow 
		ridge levels off, but becomes narrow and very exposed. In places the hot 
		weather of recent weeks has rotted its very foundations, and great sections 
		seem poised for a topple into space. </P>
	  <P>Just here 
		the crest is divided into two thin flanges by a narrow track about two 
		feet deep. and the flange on the right leans out- wards and is obviously 
		unstable. almost a small cornice in fact. I am following the line of footsteps 
		when suddenly my right foot shoots through into space and I subside into 
		the trench. My weight is supported over the drop mainly by the rotten 
		right wall. Panic! How can I get up again without dislodging both the 
		cornice and myself? Phil gets ready for the sensational jump and I start 
		easing myself up. For a horrible moment I am leaning heavily on the unstable 
		snow – but it holds. </P>
	  <P>The ridge 
		turns rocky, the going is easy and the mind wanders ... It’s hard to decide 
		whether all this effort is worth it. Of course if there was a luxurious 
		bed waiting in the valley things wouldn’t be so bad. A good bed can make 
		all other hardships seem bearable – not so a soggy pit and punctured lilo 
		which serve only to induce traumatic visions of tantalising women and 
		great heaps of goodies... </P>
	  <P>The need 
		for a decision interrupts my thoughts. We can either descend a couloir 
		or continue down the ridge to the head of the glacier, which will be longer 
		but safer. Through a break in the cloud Phil spots a nasty bergschrund 
		on the glacier. We have already had quite enough fun with bergschrunds 
		for one season so we plunge down the couloir. </P>
	  <P>It is a 
		bad decision. The couloir is long, steep, and atrociously loose. In the 
		upper part a fusilade of stones whines over our heads. and from that point 
		on I can feel the nerves standing out like pin-pricks all over me. We 
		are sending down a stream of boulders, unavoidably. If the East ridge 
		party enters the couloir above us our position will not be enviable. </P>
	  <P>It takes 
		an hour to descend the couloir, and the last few hundred feet are just 
		a frantic rush for safety. Then at last we are out on the glacier and 
		the tension is off. Half-glissading and half falling, half- running and 
		half-stumbling, we tumble down the snowy slopes thinking only of the hut 
		and a brew. </P>
	  <P>But when 
		we get there, at 3.30, the warden is nowhere to be seen and the stove 
		isn’t even alight... </P>
	  <P>Evening 
		fell as we approached Randa and the rain slanted down from a murky sky. 
		Phil thought he saw a train so we forced unwilling legs into a run and 
		reached the station panting, condensation dripping from our cagoules. 
		But Phil was wrong. </P>
	  <P>Three hours 
		later we were still waiting. Night had fallen, and the little group of 
		people on the platform was beginning to realise that for some reason the 
		trains weren’t running. It was too much effort to dig duvets from the 
		depths of rucksacks so we were cold, and having hardly eaten all day we 
		felt miserably hungry. Above all what we wanted was kip. As it is a two 
		hour walk from Randa to Zermatt, we were pretty angry. </P>
	  <P>We got back 
		in the end by hitching lifts along the cart track which the inhabitants 
		use as a road – and next day I actually managed to get some money back 
		off the Swiss for the tickets we hadn’t used. In Zermatt it had been raining 
		heavily and the campsite was a sea of mud. We squelched over to the tent, 
		threw down our gear, and slept. </P>
