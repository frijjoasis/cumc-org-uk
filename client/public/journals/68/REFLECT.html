		<H1>REFLECTIONS ON A MINIBUS MEET TO DERBYSHIRE</H1>

	  <P>I HAVE often 
		wondered what they must think at the pub in Grantham – though they are 
		not without their own peculiarities: the Leviathan landlady helped by 
		a wizened grandad. and the assorted clientele silently bored near the 
		juke. What do they think when on a winter Sunday night the door bursts 
		open to admit a motley rabble, blooded and bedraggled, looking for all 
		the world like a band of pantomime pirates? Scarcely a brow flickers as 
		the bar is overwhelmed; the faint smell of peat hardly flares a nostril 
		as fire and dartboard are monopolised. This after all is the C.U.M.C. 
		</P>
	  <P>It all starts 
		in the damp pre-dawn of Cambridge. A passer-by might almost take the subdued 
		group in the shadow of the Senate House for gunpowder conspirators – especially 
		if he were to glimpse a figure vainly trying to reach some gargoyle on 
		a Caius archway. But presently the minibus arrives, friendly obscenities 
		are exchanged, and the public-spirited distribute gear on the roof, while 
		the cunning appropriate the few tolerable seats. The Meets Secretary does 
		his mental arithmetic, roundly abusing latecomers, and the meet roars 
		off. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		lap is the time for meditation or slumber, depending on the extent of 
		Saturday’s revelry. The drunkards lie in contorted positions, dreaming 
		blissfully; the philosophical few remain awake – sometimes the driver 
		too. The scene is uniformly grey. Mists cloak the fields and muffle the 
		skeletal trees. The eye turns naturally to the dripping hedgerows and 
		the pitiful ruffled grass at the road’s edge. Only the optimist fixes 
		his gaze to the right, claiming to discern rose-pink streamers and the 
		yellow glow of dawn. </P>
	  <P>The landmarks 
		rush by silently. Gradually the sleepers sense the approach of food, and 
		in cracked voices ask the time and place. For the last few miles almost 
		everyone is awake, staring gloomily at the signs and the distant blue-topped 
		caf&eacute;. With a final swerve the roundabout succumbs, the ’bus is 
		parked, and the horde surges out to breakfast. </P>
	  <P>The caf&eacute; 
		never closes, and early on a Sunday the custom is a queer mixture of the 
		morning after and the night before. Sometimes great gangs of fishermen 
		precede us in the queue, chatting animatedly in wellingtons and sou’westers, 
		and often in the corners a few lead-eyed drivers doze and nod. Greasy 
		eggs or lukewarm beans are not to everyone’s taste at 8 a.m. on a Sunday 
		morning, and some even scorn the orange tea. Most, however, overcome the 
		flesh and put something away for the hardships to come, while the hardened 
		cynics smack their lips with gusto. Papers and kit-kats amassed, discussion 
		turns to climbing – where to go? Warmed by food, enthusiasm begins to 
		rumble in its pit, but rarely stirs itself sufficiently. Decisions are 
		shelved till a more pressing time, and the second lap begins. The atmosphere 
		now is more mundane. The nervous or ambitious thumb the guidebook, the 
		frustrated read &quot;Reveille&quot;, the amiable chatter, the morose 
		glower, the driver tries. Eventually circumstance forces a choice of crag, 
		and we arrive at Stanage. </P>
	  <P>Beneath 
		the rock the skirmishes begin. One wants to climb V. Diff., .html V.S. 
		Perhaps both want to lead the same route, perhaps neither. Sometimes each 
		conceives a strange desire to use the other’s rope. Novice meets make 
		smaller demands on speed of thought, but require finer judgement. Pick 
		a likely-looking innocent, beware the bulging lunch pack, but pounce on 
		the gleaming rope. </P>
	  <P>Instruction 
		is usually well-intentioned, long, and ineffectual: &quot;Get the twist 
		on the other hand. Round your waist, not your neck.&quot; &quot;Clench 
		it like this – if it hurts. it’s a good one.&quot; &quot;Don’t fall off!&quot; 
		Novices are usually very understanding. When you grimace and explain that 
		Stanage V. Diffs. are rather hard for their grade, they smile politely. 
		When you indicate the holds you used but suggest that Tuf-boots might 
		not stay on those particular rugosities, they wait patiently for further 
		advice. They even appreciate the overwhelming priority of removing your 
		nuts from the loathsome cracks they find themselves committed to. </P>
	  <P>Economy 
		of effort is not a skill immediately acquired by novice climbers. Naturally, 
		therefore, half a dozen well-chosen gritstone cracks weary them somewhat, 
		and induce a welcome desire to rest and enjoy the bracing air of the moors. 
		This being so, the experienced members of the meet join forces, reluctant 
		to waste any of their costly opportunity to climb. Thus it comes about 
		that towards the end of a novice meet the scene is identical to that on 
		an ordinary meet. The club hards are to be seen in various positions on 
		ludicrous overhanging crevices, while the passing gapers mock below. The 
		stalwarts of the ranks are astonishingly finding yet .html anomaly in 
		the guidebook severes, and the sane or female huddle under overhangs out 
		of the wind, or on a fine day lie among the heather and millstones, savouring 
		the wide hazy view to Kinder. </P>
	  <P>As dusk 
		approaches the flocks start to leave. Eventually the last recalcitrant 
		nut is coaxed out, the last marooned soloist rescued by top-rope, the 
		last route abandoned for .html time, and the party reunited at the minibus. 
		Eagerly at first the successes are recounted, then the aborts are revealed, 
		and finally the secret lobs and swings are dragged out. Scars are exhibited; 
		inevitably the guidebook is cursed. Once more the start of Verandah Buttress 
		is pronounced desperate, and Black Slab declared harder than Via Media. 
		One hears that Macnair has conquered such and such a redoubtable route, 
		that Hird has solved some impossible boulder problem, that Guilliard’s 
		neck has shrunk on yet .html challenge. It is all gloated over and repeated, 
		and everyone shares vicariously in the glory or misery of the meet. </P>
	  <P>As the conversation 
		becomes more desultory, hunger asserts itself. Mansfield and Newark seem 
		to reappear continually along the road. At long last the eating place 
		is reached, and Dittner inevitably wins the headlong rush to the counter. 
		A dozen portions of &quot;the lot plus chips&quot;, or equivalent, are 
		bought, and in their afterglow satisfaction begins to spread like a blanket 
		over the mind. With full stomach and pleasant anticipation of imminent 
		ale, all those cracks and slabs become less ferocious – quite feasible 
		in fact, if conditions had been suitable. </P>
	  <P>Then the 
		pub in Grantham and after, tired limbs and light heads pile into the minibus 
		dark for the final lap. The driver pretends to maintain a sober respect 
		for the law, but the rest surrender themselves to the unerring musical 
		instincts of the club. The repertoire is wide, the vocabulary broader. 
		The sagas of heroic characters from the frozen north, the Highlands, Mobile, 
		and many other lands are reverently narrated. The modest minority feel 
		a sudden concern for the safety of the vehicle or are overcome by weariness. 
		</P>
	  <P>And so back, 
		to stagger out under Great St. Mary’s amongst the well-dressed church 
		and party-goers. You limp away down Trinity Street, standing out like 
		a sore thumb, but feeling like some hard man of the hills back from a 
		great pilgrimage. </P>
