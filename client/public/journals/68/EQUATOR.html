	  <P>THE mountaineer 
		in Kenya is a lucky man. Provided he can endure Africa�s discomforts of 
		intense heat. dense bush, and the countless insects, he has at his disposal 
		an unlimited supply of rock and ice. The highest peak is Kilimanjaro, 
		with an ice-capped crater soaring up to nineteen thousand feet, but undoubtedly 
		the star attraction is Mt. Kenya. and it was here that I found myself 
		along with Martin Harris and Sylvano Borruso in the August of 1966. </P>
	  <P>Mt. Kenya 
		and its satellites form a superb area for climbing. The problems and scale 
		are Alpine, the weather far more reliable. The central peaks of Nelion 
		(17,019 ft.) and Batian (17,055 ft.) give long routes on rock and ice, 
		while the myriad lesser peaks provide shorter routes, ideal for the very 
		necessary acclimatisation to these altitudes, as well as being seamed 
		with possible new routes. The approach to the mountain is long, twenty 
		miles from the nearest farm, and far from pleasant. The muddy bamboo thickets 
		give way to giant heather and groundsels � like nightmare cabbages gone 
		to seed � then monster tussocks and slimy hollows which give really foul 
		going. </P>
	  <P>It was after 
		two days of this glimpse of purgatory that we arrived and established 
		ourselves at Two Tarn hut. In the evening the shadowy mists which had 
		clung to the hillsides all day finally cleared, and we saw the mountain 
		before us towering above the tarn, its twin summits golden in the setting 
		sun. The next few days were spent acclimatising. I lay on a warm slab 
		watching the others perform on Midget Peak across the valley the first 
		day, but then I felt better so Martin and I stormed up the N.W. ridge 
		of Pt. Piggot. It was slabby, unprotected and nice, and the sun was very 
		pleasant on top. But the afternoon mists drifted in and a guidebook was 
		consulted. Abseils down to the Tyndall glacier were the done thing, though 
		it looked steep. But if Baillie could do it, so could Harris. Eight hours 
		later we arrived on the glacier, swearing never to read a guidebook again. 
		</P>
	  <P>We had had 
		enough of Two Tarn hut and so next day we were staggering round to Kami 
		hut for the North face routes and the serious business of the trip. While 
		Martin heroically went back again for more food, Sylvano and I looked 
		at the nearby N.E. face of Pt. Dutton. There were no recorded ascents 
		of this face. We roped up at the foot of an easy looking chimney. Twenty 
		minutes later we were back at the bottom again and finding a way round 
		left. At last we were off up cracks and grooves which gave pleasant climbing, 
		about IV sup. by Kenya standards, then we were on the piled gendarmes 
		of the N.E. ridge which soon led to the twin summit blocks. We chose a 
		loose looking gully for the descent, and were just sipping a brew back 
		at the hut when there was this lethal-sounding trundle which turned out 
		to be coming straight down our evil little gully. The snow continued all 
		night for a change, so we festered until it stopped, then went to prospect 
		next day�s route, the Firmin-Hicks, the North face standard route on Batian. 
		</P>
	  <P>We were 
		off at 5 a.m. stumbling over the rocks. When we reached the bottom of 
		the first pitch the dawn was only a thin red line on the horizon, and 
		so we kept ourselves warm by falling off until it was light enough to 
		see. Quickly we were up the first gully in a torrent of conflicting instructions 
		and muttered curses. When we reached the amphitheatre above it was glowing 
		yellow in the early morning sun and bits of cotton wool clouds were forming 
		over the northern deserts. </P>
	  <P>Across the 
		amphitheatre rose the Firmin tower, cleft by a deep icy crack. Harris 
		left his rucksack to me and thrutched up it. It was only V. Diff., but 
		hard enough at 16,500 ft. Tiptoeing along the ridge above we saw the Northey 
		glacier sweep up into nothingness on our right. A steep bit, a heave and 
		a grunt, and we were at the Japanese bivouac � a lovely bit of dry stone-walling. 
		The rest of the route slowly disappeared behind us: Shipton�s notch, a 
		crest of grotty pink rock which we straddled and watched the flakes slide 
		away into anonymity in the mists of Batian�s West face; an ice gully on 
		the South face, then the summit. It was twelve noon, we were at 17,000 
		ft., and I felt lousy. Down quickly, before the snow comes. But too late 
		as usual, and so we resigned ourselves to .html gully full of wet snow, 
		waterfalls, and jamming abseil ropes. At last the hut arrived and at 5.30 
		p.m. we tumbled in, pleased at having made a competent time on the route. 
		The record was 55 hours in ideal conditions. </P>
	  <P>Next day 
		Sylvano left for the sun and sand of the coast, and the following day 
		we tried the Window Ar&ecirc;te on Pt. Peter. a short but hard route, 
		graded V and A1. I felt hard and led an awkward groove with no runners. 
		Martin didn�t like it. He got gripped on the pegging too, being only a 
		little hard man, so I had to do it, only to get launched into a desperate 
		layback after the pegs. Easy rocks led to the top and I felt chuffed. 
		Martin was depressed. </P>
	  <P>Our big 
		target for this trip was the N.W, pillar of Nelion. First climbed by Cliff 
		and Rutowitz in three days, and graded V sup. and A2, it lacked a second 
		ascent. Harris wasn�t so keen, but such was my elation that I promised 
		to lead all the hard pitches. The evil light of dawn saw us pratting despondently 
		about on the Krapf glacier. Martin took hours over the first pitch, then 
		I started off on the second and fell off. So much for the hard man � Martin 
		took over, and disappeared up a horrid looking chimney. The chimney was 
		horrid and I thrutched up it aching from my lob. But above we moved leftwards 
		into the sun with the yawning glacier beneath, and life felt better even 
		though I did have the big sack. At 10.30 we crossed the amphitheatre and 
		the site of Cliff�s first bivouac and felt even better. A long groove 
		and we�ll be up before dark. </P>
	  <P>Nemesis 
		came, in the form of the afternoon snow shower. It was 2.30 now. and we 
		hid under an overhang trying to identify the next pitch. Martin eventually 
		pegged a damp crack. Above was obviously the �sunlit slab climbed for 
		sheer joy� of the original description. We climbed it because there was 
		no other way. It was plastered in soft snow and I followed unashamedly 
		on a tight rope. Another pitch up an evil wet crack on evil wet wedges 
		brought us to Cliff�s second bivouac. However it was deep in snow, so 
		I pressed on up an easy pitch above to a dry sloping ledge, found the 
		flattest part, and brought up Martin. Here we bivouacked. It was 5.30 
		and the tropical night was an hour away, if �tropical� is the right word 
		for any night spent at nearly seventeen thousand feet. </P>
	  <P>The sun 
		was high over the yellow plains before we stirred. I set off along the 
		traverse line looking for a Grey Slab. No sign of one, so I came back 
		sixty feet and found the peg and krab Cliff had used for his tension traverse. 
		Martin bounced across and I followed, slithering, cursing and slipping 
		after him. More pitches followed for me to get gripped on, a last thrutchy 
		redeeming chimney, and we crawled on to the summit in the best Alpine 
		fashion. </P>
	  <P>The descent 
		remained, but as usual this presented problems. Our plans to traverse 
		to Batian and go down the Firmin-Hicks were foiled when we saw how icy 
		was the south face of Batian. We hadn�t much hemp and after our epic on 
		Pt. Piggot Martin�s red rope was noticeably shorter than the white, so 
		abseiling back down the route was vetoed. There remained the S.E. face 
		of Nelion, normally the usual route, but very icy at this time of year. 
		Step cutting downhill with a peg hammer provided the first unpleasant 
		thrill, and the final abseils were in true Mt. Kenya tradition of slippery 
		snow and wet jamming ropes. Eventually we were down and trudged across 
		the Lewis glacier to a brew at the top hut. It was 4.30 p.m. and we were 
		on the wrong side of the hill. The mist thickened around us as we set 
		out again over Lenana, the third highest peak, for the Kami hut. Out came 
		the map and compass, but we were off the map. So we resorted to following 
		a ridge down, and in a short mist clearance there was the hut above us. 
		In the last flicker of daylight we staggered into the hut. Colin and Alec 
		fed us and tucked us in our pits. </P>
	  <P>We were 
		finished with the mountain now. All that remained was to trudge back down 
		through the mud and forest in the rain, watching for grey elephant shapes 
		that loomed and rustled through the mist. </P>
