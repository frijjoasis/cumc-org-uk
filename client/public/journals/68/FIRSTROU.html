	  <P>SOMETHING 
		soft and wet settled on my nose, waking me from a light, uneasy sleep. 
		Then something tickled my chin. Slowly I became aware that a gentle pattering 
		had replaced the gusty violence of the wind. Sleep dispelled, I opened 
		my eyes to find that the great yellow moon which had hung over us earlier 
		in the night, so solicitously, it had seemed, was gone. I was shut up 
		in a closed little world of thickly-falling snow and already covered with 
		a layer an inch thick. </P>
	  <P>Without 
		warning there was a flash of lightning that brightened for a moment the 
		all-enveloping gloom of grey-whiteness, closely followed by a heavens-tearing 
		clap of thunder. Soon the storm was directly overhead. I could not see 
		the others. but I knew they also must be wishing that the metal gear could 
		be moved further away. Isolated on our narrow, lonely ledge, however, 
		there was nothing to do but feel distinctly afraid as lightning glowed 
		behind our white curtain, and thunderclap on thunderclap crashed and reverberated 
		about us. Half-heartedly humming appropriate strains from Wagner, I envied 
		Siegfried his confidence. </P>
	  <P>... I don�t 
		remember whose choice it was, but it had seemed a good one at the time 
		� just the thing for our first route, not difficult, and, according to 
		the guide-book, only six hours to the summit and two and a half down. 
		</P>
	  <P>So we slogged 
		up to the nearest hut, gasping and panting from the effects of altitude 
		and unfitness, and at three o�clock the next morning were threading our 
		way over the glacier, a full moon lighting up a ghostly mountainscape 
		of black and silver. </P>
	  <P>We were 
		still on it as the stars began to fade, and a faint rose- tint permeated 
		the sky in front of us. &quot;Like something out of a book, isn�t it?&quot; 
		remarked John. Guiltily I thought of the innumerable descriptions of dawn 
		in the mountains that I had skipped over impatiently. </P>
	  <P>Reaching 
		the ridge we were confronted by a sheet of steep ice, but someone was 
		clearly in front of us, for a series of fresh steps had been cut straight 
		up it. </P>
	  <P>On up more 
		snow slopes till we came to the first of the rock gendarmes, turned on 
		its left by traversing round on steep rock, crampons striking sparks and 
		a sensational drop below, but with big, comforting jugs to grasp. Back 
		onto the ridge to a knife-edge of rotten snow that could not possibly 
		take one�s weight but somehow did. And so to the next gendarme. Rock and 
		rotten snow alternating, we gradually worked our way up the ridge; but 
		the care demanded by the dangerous state of the snow was taking up precious 
		time, and already we were behind schedule. </P>
	  <P>The heat 
		was intense now. From under my helmet sweat trickled down my forehead 
		and into my eyes. More rotten snow. Yet .html gendarme. </P>
	  <P>At last 
		the summit came into sight. Figures were moving about � but it was still 
		a long way off, and mid-day was upon us already. In all our minds was 
		the guide book warning about the descent: &quot;... prone to avalanche 
		in the afternoon&quot;. It seemed easier to continue though, than to turn 
		back, and we pressed on. </P>
	  <P>Slowly the 
		final rock pillar drew nearer. It was unclimbable direct, so, in the lead, 
		I by-passed it and followed the traces of some old steps up a steep little 
		ice gully. It was steeper than I had realized, and the steps had weathered 
		to mere scrapes in the ice. The party in front had obviously found an 
		easier way up. Suddenly aware of the drop below, I laboriously chopped 
		myself larger holds for hands and feet, and carefully moved up into the 
		narrow exit chimney. To one side was a narrow rib of rock that seemed 
		to offer easier climbing than the ice. Unfortunately, the holds ran out 
		and before long I found myself bridged precariously with front-points 
		in the ice on one side of the chimney, one point in contact with the rock 
		on the other. My right leg started to tremble. Hurriedly I cut a step 
		higher up for my left foot, fashioned a handhold in the ice, and moved 
		up on the one crampon point that was on rock. Then the angle eased. Two 
		more steps to cut, over some boulders, and I was on the summit. </P>
	  <P>We did not 
		linger there as we were anxious to push on down as quickly as possible. 
		At this stage we were joined by the two Frenchmen who had been in front 
		of us. Uncertain of the way down, they had waited for us � and we ourselves 
		were dependent on the guide- book description. It was going to be a case 
		of the blind leading the blind, with the sole link between the two, my 
		schoolboy French that was not simply rusty, but positively corroded. </P>
	  <P>At first 
		it was easy going along a well-defined rock ridge. but soon we had to 
		leave it to descend a snow slope made treacherously soft by the glare 
		of the afternoon sun. Cautiously we had to belay our way down, following 
		a ribbon of boulders. It was slow going, with a party of six. The snow 
		needed the greatest care, and language difficulties were proving a hindrance. 
		Time was dragging on. </P>
	  <P>All at once 
		we became aware of cloud billowing up from the valley below, heaving and 
		pulsating like some gigantic creature. and within seconds we were engulfed 
		in its cold, clammy maw. With route-finding in the mist added to our problems, 
		progress was slower than ever. </P>
	  <P>It was with 
		relief that we arrived at a steep rock gully, recognizable from the guide 
		book description, and we scrambled down it until it gave onto more snow 
		slopes. But by now the mist had closed right down, the snow was still 
		untrustworthy, and darkness was coming on. A bivouac was clearly unavoidable, 
		and there was nothing for it but to climb back up the gully to look for 
		a suitable site. </P>
	  <P>The Frenchmen 
		decided to stay at the foot of the gully in a highly uncomfortable-looking 
		spot, and we were amazed to discover that they had no bivouac equipment 
		beyond a spare pullover each. I decided that I was not going to freeze 
		for their sake, but I felt I had to do something, and gave them a spare 
		brew-kit, and some food. Having eased my conscience and wished them &quot;bonne 
		nuit&quot;, I continued up the gully, thankful that I was not in their 
		position. </P>
	  <P>Near the 
		top we found a ledge large enough to enable us to recline in fair comfort. 
		It was, however, totally unsheltered, and an ominously rising wind was 
		blowing icily straight into our faces, piercing our clothing with no difficulty. 
		It took real will-power to take down my breeches and pull on a pair of 
		long johns underneath. The stove meanwhile was fighting a losing battle 
		with the wind and eventually we gave up, drinking the tea tepid, and chewing 
		dry oatmeal blocks without enthusiasm. Afterwards, all we could do was 
		sit and wait. </P>
	  <P>I may or 
		may not have dozed off, but once I opened my eyes to find the mist dispersed 
		and the moon shining. And then the next thing I was aware of was the steady 
		pattering of snow... </P>
	  <P>We waited 
		two hours, until the thunder had faded to a distant mutter and a faint 
		lightening of the gloom hinted at daybreak, before we stood up stiffly 
		and set to work sorting out wirelike ropes and trying to fasten ice-sheathed 
		crampon straps. The gully we had climbed down and up again with such ease 
		the previous evening was now a very different proposition, with every 
		hold hidden beneath a uniform white blanket. and it was only after much 
		search that we uncovered a small flake. Two abseils took us to the bottom 
		where we found the two Frenchmen waiting for us, looking cold and wet, 
		and reticent about the night they had spent, but otherwise none the worse 
		for wear. </P>
	  <P>Here it 
		dawned on us that the snow was easing off, and the sky showed signs of 
		clearing. Below, we could see the col which we knew gave onto the glacier. 
		Feeling a lot happier we roped down a series of snow slopes, finding to 
		our relief that one could gain a purchase beneath the layer of soft powder. 
		By the time we reached the col, the sun was dispelling the last vestiges 
		of mist and it was clearly going to be a brilliant day. Off with duvets 
		and out with the stove, a cheerful speck of blue in the vast white landscape. 
		</P>
	  <P>Peering 
		over the edge of the col we saw that we should have to descend a slope 
		that seemed formidably steep, with a bergschrund we knew to be awkward 
		at the bottom of it. We could make out the traces of old steps going straight 
		down the centre, and although it was necessary to kick fresh ones, Pete 
		followed them, finding the snow, perhaps because of its steepness, pleasantly 
		free from powder. Rather than belay half way down, the two ropes were 
		tied together, and it was at the end of nearly three hundred feet that 
		Pete arrived at the bergschrund. To the right and left of him, it was 
		a gaping trench up to twenty feet wide, with a considerable drop between 
		its upper and lower lips; but immediately below him, although the slope 
		steepened to well past the vertical, there seemed to be no actual gap. 
		Shouting that he wanted to be lowered. he let himself over the edge, and 
		the stretch in the nylon immediately carried him to the snow, fifteen 
		feet below. Cheerfully he shouted up: &quot;This is the only way over 
		the bergschrund, but it�s only a four foot drop.&quot; </P>
	  <P>The others 
		went down without mishap, and then it was my turn. John had cut himself 
		a stance in the snow some way above the bergschrund and belayed me from 
		there. But nevertheless, as I started down, kicking firmly into each step, 
		I was very conscious that I was 200 ft. above him. Thankfully, I arrived 
		at the stance, and from there proceeded to lower John over. An apprehensive 
		wait ensued while the others arranged a belay firm enough to hold me when 
		I jumped. I could see nothing, and had no idea of what lay below, but 
		I had a shrewd suspicion that the drop was more than four feet. </P>
	  <P>At last 
		they were ready for me, and I descended to the lip of the bergschrund 
		reluctantly placing my feet in the last steps before the slope disappeared. 
		Still I could see nothing. Just in case, I put my glasses into an anorak 
		pocket. You never know... Mike�s encouraging voice suddenly seemed a long 
		way off. I wondered how firm that belay was � below, the glacier stretched 
		straight and steep for a long way. Still, there was no point hanging about, 
		we had been on the climb quite long enough already. And before my resolution 
		had a chance to waver. I stepped backwards into nothing. The unpleasant 
		sensation of falling free through space, normally confined to nightmares, 
		seemed to last a long time. Then thump, I landed slap on my back, and 
		head first started off down the glacier. I was beginning to wonder what 
		had happened to the rope, when it came taut, and I was able to right myself 
		in time to watch my balaclava rolling merrily into a crevasse several 
		hundred feet below.. Wondering how the camera in my sac had fared, I cleared 
		the snow out of my ears and nose, and remarked with feeling that some 
		people should learn to estimate height. Pete, however, refused to be nonplussed; 
		he had put my performance on film, and was full of the slanderous inferences 
		to be drawn. </P>
	  <P>From there 
		it was plain sailing. Down the subsidiary glacier below us, across the 
		glacier proper with its maze of crevasses. and wearily over the moraine 
		to the hut. feeling as if every ounce of liquid had been sucked out of 
		us, and wanting only to drink and drink and drink. We were met by the 
		warden. carrying a pair of binoculars. Tactfully, he confined himself 
		to a dry &quot;Bonne course. eh?&quot; &quot;Tr&egrave;s bonne&quot; we 
		agreed. It had taken thirty-eight hours. </P>
