		<H1>A NIGHT-TIME ESCAPADE</H1>
		<H2>ANON</H2>
	  </DIV>
	  
	  <P>IT was just 
		before midnight that I blundered into College, cheerily singing an ode 
		to that immortal of hunters, Dinah? and surreptitiously swinging my Don 
		Whillans near my feet, in the fond belief that it would not arouse the 
		curiosity of the porter. Evidently the words of my ditty jarred his sobriety 
		somewhat, because as I lurched towards Postumus’ abode I was pursued by 
		a rattle of keys. I overstepped the staircase. turned round the corner 
		and sank into the shadows – these were very prickly. The keys stopped, 
		vaguely searched the court and finding nothing, retired to their hook 
		with a snort. I slipped back to Postumus’ rooms, put a record on, sat 
		down and allowed the haze of an evening’s port to drift over my consciousness... 
		</P>
	  <P>P – duly 
		arrived and set to work straightening some pegs on my head. I woke up. 
		We sat it out until 2 a.m., knocking back the remains of the port and 
		enjoying Bach. </P>
	  <P>As the clocks 
		chimed we conspiratorially pulled on our P.A.’s and whilst I searched 
		for rope and runners, P – donned the rest of his outfit. I turned to see 
		what I first considered to be St. Michael, come down to chat to me about 
		sins and such things. In fact, on closer examination, it turned out to 
		be P – adorned in fluorescent red anorak and white crash-hat. As he refused 
		to change, we soon found ourselves stealing furtively out of College, 
		St. Michael and his shadow, over a wall and gliding across lawns to the 
		main road. </P>
	  <P>It was at 
		2.05 a.m. that Postumus first began to have doubts about his attire. &quot;Oh 
		Cassius,&quot; quoth he, &quot;can one not reasonably expect that at this 
		generous hour sober citizens will be in bed asleep, and the main road 
		devoid of life and light?&quot; Alas, whatever the logical mind were to 
		suppose, the area surrounding our objective – the East face of the University 
		Press Tower – bore a closer relationship to Oxford Circus than to the 
		graveyard we had yearned for. Further, it was brilliantly illuminated. 
		</P>
	  <P>We flitted 
		past our &quot;intended&quot; to take refuge in the shadows on the North 
		side of the building. Both my glowing friend and I were becoming apprehensive. 
		A don appeared out of the gloom and we did the opposite. Trusting to luck 
		we walked back to the main door, each of us to our allocated side and 
		climbed quickly into the saintless niche where we paused to contemplate 
		the delights of the subsequent ten feet or so. During these few seconds 
		a car passed – nothing extraordinary about this as they were doing so 
		with disturbing frequency. This car, however, distinguished itself from 
		its fellows by not continuing its intended course. It stopped and undertook 
		a series of operations which I will charitably describe as reversing. 
		Two heads appeared at the window, whilst we posed as saints in our respective 
		alcoves, prepared for an unsaintly bunk. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Good 
		luck,&quot; came a hearty shout, and no sooner said than the car roared 
		off with its handbrake on. This was rectified and it roared off more effectively. 
		</P>
	  <P>We continued 
		our respective routes up to the bottom of the Bay Window and P – then 
		traversed left to reach my side. Installed in comfort at this point. we 
		undid the rope and found a belay. Although P – had already attempted this 
		face before it remained virgin, so I generously offered him the possibility 
		of revenge. My real reason for granting him this pleasure may be apparent 
		to those who survey the S.E. facet of the Bay Window. The ledges slope 
		somewhat and the denticles, strung like so many stone beads between the 
		mullions, are soft enough to eat. P – went up and paused half way to arrange 
		protection on these little teeth; an action which reminded me forcibly 
		of an occasion when I grabbed a tuft of grass, tied a knot in it and threaded 
		a runner through the same. </P>
	  <P>Ten minutes 
		later I pulled over the overhang at the top of the window to join Postumus 
		on his stance. Here we discussed the joys of the pitch to come, which 
		he hastened to remind me was the occasion for a lob on his first attempt. 
		This occurred whilst surmounting the small pinnacle which stands on the 
		right buttress, and thus provides an excellent mantelshelf without which 
		the charms of the climb would be incomplete. Before doing this the crux 
		must be overcome. From the right hand side of the ledge on top of the 
		Bay Window one steps down and across six feet of blank wall to a small 
		hold on the right buttress of the tower. There is nothing to support the 
		climber on this move until his foot is on the requisite little charmer, 
		which is a good way above the ground and not so loftily above suspicion. 
		</P>
	  <P>P – leapt 
		up the climb with enthusiasm whilst I sat belaying him, invoking the gods 
		and contemplating sanity. The sky was already brighter and the heavens 
		were painted that washed-out grey of dawn. The exit at the top was proving 
		tiresome and P – had not put a runner on in the last forty feet. The difficulty 
		lay in persuading a packet of biscuits, which is camouflaged as a pinnacle 
		at the top, that it should not unreasonably and malevolently break off 
		when force was applied. Eventually he pulled out on the left so avoiding 
		the delicate excrescence and leaving it for the admiration of tourists 
		– a thoroughly commendable action. A whoop of joy descended and the rope 
		was drawn in. </P>
	  <P>I tottered 
		over to the right hand side of the window and contemplated the step across, 
		cursing the fact that I had been sitting jammed between two ornaments 
		as my right leg was now numb. Having decided that the move across was 
		impossible and that there is no dishonour in failing in that sphere, I 
		had a go at it. I performed the splits beautifully and just got my foot 
		on the elusive thing on the right. At this point the gods chose to reply 
		to my earlier blasphemous invocations by giving me cramp in the aforementioned 
		foot, so I scuttled back to the top of the Bay. </P>
	  <P>Five minutes 
		later, a rapidly approaching sunrise inspired a second attempt. It went 
		– with a tight rope from above in case of failure. The rest of the buttress 
		provided delightfully exposed climbing of technical interest, and the 
		top was done direct with a delicacy that my comparative lack of weight 
		afforded – the pinnacle behaved as it was told to. </P>
	  <P>Soon enough 
		the sky filled with light and we made ourselves scarce, regretting only 
		that the pubs were not open. It had been an interesting night. </P>
