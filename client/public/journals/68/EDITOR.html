	  <P>LIKE last 
		year’s Editor. I must apologise for the late appearance of this publication. 
		However, I will not attempt any excuses. Certainly it is not due to any 
		fault of Charles Elphick Limited, our printers, who we must thank for 
		being impressively efficient and once again very helpful. Thanks are also 
		due to Rob Collister for looking after the finances and to the contributors 
		for their countless hours of labour. </P>
	  <P>The disappearance 
		from Cambridge of our brillo pad eater, Bob Keates, completed the departures 
		from the club of the more colourful characters of recent years. Consequently 
		it has been a relatively quiet year with a lot of solid medium-standard 
		climbing being done rather than anything spectacular. A disturbing feature 
		is that it has all been done by second and third year people and, so far, 
		few freshers have emerged as competent. A possible reason is that the 
		Foot and Mouth outbreak wiped out many of the meets. It is encouraging 
		that the support for the remaining meets has been overwhelming. As yet, 
		the popularity of. the vac. meets has not been fully ascertained due to 
		Footh and Mouth, although the Glencoe meet early in the New Year was well 
		attended. This is the first time the meet has been held and it may well 
		take a permanent place in the meets calendar. The current interest in 
		Scottish winter climbing is reflected here. As usual though, the bulk 
		of the climbing has been done in Wales and Derbyshire. The Lake District 
		has yet again been neglected. </P>
	  <P>Some of 
		the more respectable achievements of the past year appear in the notes 
		so I will not comment here except to say that the credit for many of these 
		goes to Gordon Macnair. We had the amusing spectacle of seeing various 
		prospective seconds being hauled off to Derbyshire and given a trial on 
		Stoney Middleton. Some were willing, some were strong, some were fit; 
		but they all had one thing in common – they all fell off. </P>
	  <P>Sad to say 
		the Alpine Meet never happened. It seems as though people preferred to 
		venture out without the guidance of Bob Keates – and who can blame them! 
		Joking apart, this is a serious matter, and it is to be hoped that this 
		year’s meet will take place and be productive. Equally sad was the absence 
		last summer of any expedition organised by club members in Cambridge. 
		John Ashburner’s account, which appears earlier in this journal, describes 
		an expedition organised in India involving only past members of the club. 
		One of the heartening things this year has been the way ex-C.U.M.C. members 
		have been doing so well. Dick Isherwood is .html notable example. Perhaps 
		I ought to explain that Dick has rejoined the club, even though this is 
		not really allowed by the constitution. </P>
	  <P>Turning 
		to social matters. the 1967 Dinner was held in Selwyn and was a more sober 
		affair than its counterpart of the previous year. General opinion was 
		that it was all the more enjoyable and there was the additional advantage 
		of being able to return to Selwyn in 1968. As usual a session of night 
		climbing followed. After the start of the Foot and Mouth this became a 
		popular activity along with pegging on the Cherryhinton tree. </P>
	  <P>An event 
		has at last been found to replace the beer party. The Meets Secretary 
		arranged a beer drinking contest against the Caving Club. As a hundred 
		pints of bitter were stacked in front of them, the teams began to look 
		a little apprehensive, but soon a merrier atmosphere pervaded the premises. 
		Somewhat chaotically the honour of the club was upheld, and a thoroughly 
		good evening was had by all. </P>
