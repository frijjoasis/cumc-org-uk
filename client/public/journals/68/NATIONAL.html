		<H1>NATIONALISATION NOW!</H1>

	  <P>THE anti-socialist 
		structure of climbing organisations in this country is a scandalous nineteenth-century 
		exploitation of the toiling masses. An evil cancer of privilege pervades 
		the system. Membership by election ensures the continuation of the old 
		order and exploits at every move the labours of the young progressive 
		climbers. Even now there is domination by members of the feudal House 
		of Lords. </P>
	  <P>Be warned: 
		the workers cannot be oppressed for ever. Solidarity of the masses will 
		sweep the old order away like a spontaneous rockfall. It must be a battle 
		to the death between South Audley Street and Archway Road. Already elements 
		of our peace-loving revolutionary group have infiltrated one of the senior 
		clubs, causing chaos at the Annual General Meeting. The eye of the proletariat 
		has at last been opened to the affairs of that provocationist league. 
		Soon they will be on their knees and the cheering masses shall at last 
		exact triumph over the capitalist jackals. </P>
	  <P>We know 
		that so-called &quot;club&quot; for what it is – see any weekend how the 
		opulent lackeys live in style in that palace they call a &quot;hut&quot;. 
		See by contrast how the downtrodden masses huddle under shreds of canvas 
		– see the squalor where the oppressed are forced to find shelter as they 
		can – so rightly called &quot;The Black Hole&quot;. Then count the gleaming 
		automobiles outside the club hut. See the privileged opportunists laughing 
		sadistically at the wretches in the gale outside, as they warm themselves 
		before a fire of ill-gotten coals. </P>
	  <P>Yet we spare 
		these Victorian ironmasters the bloodbath they so richly deserve. The 
		true revolutionary spirit of the country has triumphed after thirteen 
		years of misrule and oppression, and we have a socialist government. </P>
	  <P>Where is 
		the conscience of the Left? </P>
	  <P>We call 
		for nationalisation NOW. </P>
	  <P>Solidarity 
		for all guides in the T.G.W.U.! </P>
	  <P>Solidarity 
		of the proletariat is the only pathway through the mires of capitalism! 
		</P>
	  <P>There must 
		be no subscription for the new organisation – Front for Alpinists of Britain. 
		Every worker’s hand must be laid on the revolutionary machine, if we are 
		to achieve equality for the proletarian climber. A small supplement to 
		the National Insurance stamp would equalise every worker’s contribution 
		to FAB, Students of course would be allowed six years from the termination 
		of studies to repay the FAB contribution. Under this system the Mountain 
		Rescue would become an extension of the ambulance service, and come under 
		the National Health Service – yet .html extension of the welfare state. 
		</P>
	  <P>Even this 
		would become unnecessary as the willing hands of forward-looking leaders 
		abolished climbing accidents. Those cunning diehards wielding power now 
		have long duped the masses into believing that accidents are an inevitable 
		part of mountaineering. This is typical of the falsehoods perpetrated 
		by these demented oppressors. </P>
	  <P>By exploiting 
		the sweating masses with artificially high prices for pitons and karabiners, 
		they hoped to intimidate the downtrodden proletariat from the high and 
		difficult moves. But they did not reckon with the courage in the hearts 
		of true revolutionary people who overcome the fear of exposure by forward-looking 
		faith in the right of their cause. Even so, there have been many martyrs; 
		good socialist blood has been shed, a crime for which the sadistic fascists 
		must pay many times over. </P>
	  <P>At one time, 
		the propaganda-mongers of South Audley Street even connived at deluding 
		the innocent and unsullied working classes into believing that the use 
		of pitons was unethical. Their introduction was attributed to Nazi climbers 
		from Munich. The truth must be told – that pitons and such implements 
		are a forward- thinking and progressive invention of undaunted socialists, 
		forced to flee from the oppression of the arch-Nazi Gestapo. Fleeing from 
		the brutal Fascist police in Switzerland, they were cornered below the 
		Eiger Nordwand. With true revolutionary zeal, they escaped upwards, aided 
		by pitons smuggled to them by brother steelworkers. The hyena police were 
		destroyed without trace by a spontaneous peace-loving stonefall. </P>
	  <P>Despite 
		the fact that pitons are a progressive socialist invention (so-called 
		&quot;American pitons&quot; are made from dies stolen by villainous CIA 
		agents), members of the reactionary Alpine Club were using them nearly 
		a century ago in provocationist manner. </P>
	  <P>In a true 
		progressive system, pitons would be placed every six inches up climbs. 
		Only by this means could there be true equality for all climbers. And 
		naturally a national anti-obesity rationing scheme would lower the average 
		body-weight of revolutionary climbers, so pitons would be less likely 
		to come out. The great program for this enlightened forward-looking scheme 
		is set out in our Five Year Plan – the Great Leap Upward. This plan also 
		entails licensing the climbers, and the setting up of checkpoints on crags 
		to ensure everyone maintains his sport plan and does not climb above his 
		grade. Opportunist provocation and dastardly incitement of competition 
		by the sadistic fascist bosses of the BMC are responsible for the accidents 
		that occur in the reactionary free-for-all that prevails today, and meanwhile 
		the downtrodden workers are bled of hard-earned wages to pay for the so-called 
		Mountain Rescue Committee. </P>
	  <P>An innovation, 
		so far suppressed by the capitalists for fear of defeat by the glorious 
		and unified Soviet peoples, would be the introduction of competitive climbing 
		on a friendly basis. The need for such a forward-thinking step has long 
		been felt by the oppressed climbers of Wales and Derbyshire. Without hoping 
		to achieve the heights reached by the victorious Soviet climbers, the 
		unchallenged champions of the world of competitive climbing, the British 
		people, with their obvious pre-Celtic Slavonic origins should easily defeat 
		the decadent nations of the warmonger West. </P>
	  <P>Workers! 
		Strive now for the silver medal at the progressive revolutionary Peoples 
		Mountaineering Olympics in the Caucasus. Soon will come that revolutionary 
		day when fifty million worker-climbers in a spontaneous demonstration 
		of solidarity will eagerly shoulder plaster busts of Chairman Wilson to 
		the summits of Snowdon and Ben Nevis. Unlike the decadent fascists under 
		the feudal leader Baron Hunt, oxygen equipment will not be used on the 
		ascent of Tryfan. </P>
	  <P>Down with 
		the decadent tyrants of South Audley Street! Down with the provocationist 
		brutality inflicted by fascist police on peace-loving climbers on Kilnsey 
		Crag! </P>
	  <P>Remember 
		the martyrs who have fallen because of the treacherous lying capitalist 
		guidebooks. </P>
	  <P>Revolution 
		now! </P>
	  <P>NOTE: These 
		reforms, originally proposed by a moderate socialist group, have obviously 
		been taken over by vociferous Communists. We await U.S. intervention. 
		</P>
