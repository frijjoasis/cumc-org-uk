	  <P>IT was hot. 
		There was sky and sun and rock wheeling above us. There were grooves and 
		slabs and pitches tumbling down towards us and past and through us. This 
		was the day of days and the climb of climbs and we were there in the middle. 
		Traversed out, finger-tensed: this was the hard part. Feet pressed outwards, 
		body arched from the rock arms stretched to the next hold. Round and up, 
		through and across, it went on, until it was the top and it was over. 
		</P>
	  <DIR> 
		<DIR> 
		  <P><I>I 
			read the news today oh boy <BR>
			About a lucky man who made the grade </I></P>
		</DIR>
	  </DIR>
	  <P>Then it 
		was .html day and the rock was wet, wet everything. The old man was 
		with me that time and we were slow. Only met him the night before, a lonely 
		old man, given up climbing really: but I was short of a climbing partner 
		so along he came and we went to Grooved Ar&ecirc;te so it wouldn’t be 
		too hard. He was a very old man, face hardened and wrists scored by rope 
		burns years ago on this very climb. When we got there it was wet and hailing 
		now and then, but he was keen by then so I started off up the cold slippery 
		rock. </P>
	  <DIR> 
		<DIR> 
		  <P><I>He 
			didn’t notice that the lights had changed <BR>
			He blew his mind out in a car </I></P>
		</DIR>
	  </DIR>
	  <P>Worried 
		on the crux. Water runs down the groove and hail fills the holds. Shivers 
		run down the rope to the old man on the ledge. He’s worried too: his leader 
		fell here so long ago and then it was bounce slither jerk but it was too 
		late. I move my foot in the groove again. Slowly stretching for the slippery 
		hold, gently pull and we’re there, relaxing as the tension drains away. 
		It’s always this way on something like this – but no time to think, here’s 
		the o1d man and we’re off up the turfy ledges above. </P>
	  <P>The old 
		man’s leading now, and we’re on the little rib that starts the final part 
		of the climb. That gives me the next pitch, the one with the long stride 
		left, and then we’re at the Haven and the hail is trickling lethally down 
		the Knight’s Slab above. The old man’s keen on leading it so off he goes. 
		At first I can see him, climbing the groove on the left. slowly and deliberately. 
		No runner on the way but I think &quot;He’s an old man, he doesn’t really 
		know about runners.&quot; Then he steps onto the slab and disappears. 
		I can tell his position from the rope: it hangs straight down from the 
		undercut slab, moving out in inches, then feet, and I think he must be 
		over the worst. Then the rope begins to move sideways and I think &quot;He 
		can’t have put a runner on before the traverse either.&quot; Then it’s 
		right out on the edge, nearly running down the Superdirect, and I think 
		&quot;He’ll just have the little move up on the edge now,&quot; but there 
		is no movement for some time. The rope quivering along the edge of the 
		overhang dislodges drops of water. I drift off, watching them spatter 
		in the groove below and join the rush to the valley. </P>
	  <DIR> 
		<DIR> 
		  <P><I>Found 
			my way upstairs and had a smoke <BR>
			Somebody spoke and I went into a dream... </I></P>
		</DIR>

	  <P>... It must 
		have been winter for I can remember the clear blue sky and the infinite 
		white line of the cornice above. The snow was hard; it sparkled and flew 
		out in a million glittering fragments with the axe. The day was a superb 
		one. I remember now. Central and South-East Gullies behind us, we were 
		going slowly down into the depths of the valley. The upper slopes were 
		weirdly half-lit as the wind whispered endlessly across them. We were 
		there on the edge of it, almost understanding – but the magic passed away 
		and all we could feel was the cold wind sighing round the peaks. Then 
		I remember that day when we walked up to the crag just near the road. 
		Not far off the ground on the second pitch the move had to be made and 
		it was harder than any move I had made before so I was scared. But why 
		not? So I bridged out on the hold and moved round, foot shaking and breath 
		catching, hands searching and finally finding the jug. After that we went 
		there many other times, but it was never as good. </P>
	  <P>And I remember 
		that summer in the far north. Lonely hills and unknown rock. The day we 
		fought for hours against the unyielding rock and the darkness until we 
		finally stood on the top and the sun went down behind the black Atlantic 
		islands, floating far out on a mirror sea. And the days of wind and rain, 
		with the bogs full and the path winding on endlessly to nowhere... </P>
	  <P>And the 
		times like this. when the rain spattered from the overhangs and the leader 
		was fighting it out above. The rope quickens and gently grates over the 
		edge above. and I think &quot;He must have made it this time,&quot; and 
		as I think that the rain and wind grow louder. But above it I can hear 
		something else: a desperate bump and scrape and a figure comes flying 
		over the edge, the rope screams out, stops and it is all silent. Eventually 
		the noise of the beck below trickles up to me and I fix the rope and look 
		over the edge. He is there, hanging in the groove, face disfigured and 
		neck broken, and his blood reddening the rocks below. And I look at my 
		wrists. scoured by the rope like his: then out at the valley, where the 
		end- less curtains of rain are shifting, and wonder if I will ever be 
		able to come back like the old man. </P>
