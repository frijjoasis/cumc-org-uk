	  <P>THE Ben 
		in March. A warm hut eases the memory of the overnight bitch and the overloaded 
		totter up endless bogs. There is a smell of routes in the air. </P>
	  <P>Only two 
		come before the thaw. Keen, we hurry up Coire na Ciste. But unfit crampon 
		muscles fitten only stepcutting ones, and stepcutting keeps crampon muscles 
		weak. A vicious circle leads straight up the buttress, pausing only to 
		be overtaken. </P>
	  <P>Dawn habitually 
		passes us by, but one gloomy noon sees us on the Douglas Boulder Gap. 
		The first rock is the last, conditions are not easy. Now difficult, now 
		not, we follow footsteps to the Eastern Traverse. They stop abruptly near 
		the top of Ogilvy�s route � that�s why they didn�t get back till eleven 
		last night, then. We keep traversing, variously to a bulging diagonal 
		ramp and an impatient direttissima, two leaders at once � knitting a safety 
		net? </P>
	  <P>From the 
		summit snows of this best of the four thousanders a Peruvian-style tightrope 
		disappears into the mist. Initial attempts are repelled. Eventually the 
		crest provides a psychological handrail as I kick delicately along one 
		excessively steep face, axe thrust deep into the other side. The top of 
		the gap. and a long search for protection a hundred feet out from a short 
		axe. The summer block belay is inextricably buried, but at last I reach 
		rock and put a peg in. Though happier now. I prefer not to jump into the 
		gap. and have to use a sling on the peg. The far side is ferocious. The 
		famous lasso spike is not in evidence. but on peering round the corner 
		I find a traverse line on steep but not unreasonable ice. A little scoop 
		leads back to the crest, deep in sloping powder here, and a necessarily 
		peculiar belay as the rope runs tight. </P>
	  <P>I hear voices 
		from the Tower, invisible across the gulf. Visions of shipwrecks and breeches 
		buoys intrude as I take the rope in. Tiredness is setting in, but no-one 
		else wants the lead. After a short pitch come longer and very icy slopes. 
		Steeper, rightwards � this must be the top. A last effort up a snow-ice 
		wall. finishing with a left traverse only just in balance, and I sink 
		over the top. Instinct brings the other two up while I sit exhausted in 
		the rime. Nearly dark. I follow the other two past what can be seen of 
		the summit, towards the ar&ecirc;te. The usual misgivings, then it appears, 
		and with a single abseil we reach easy going. </P>
	  <P>One Brenva 
		face looks much like .html when it�s snowing. </P>
	  <P>Fierce days, 
		palmy days. </P>
	  <P>&quot;La 
		plus belle des grandes routes du Mont Blanc&quot; � and a great ambition 
		realised. The same exhaustion, tempered by satisfaction, as the ridge 
		is reached and the vast face is once more there, not here. About noon, 
		the weather still perfect, we�ll be down no bother. Here far more than 
		in Scotland it can be dangerous to relax on reaching the top; luckily 
		this time I don�t feel the same need to lose the initiative. This is a 
		Mediterranean instead of an Arctic country, and on a day like this feels 
		correspondingly less serious, apart from the alarming extent to which 
		the overhead sun infiltrates the snow. I suppose a real snowman should 
		resent the sun. </P>
	  <P>Even from 
		the valley the Innominata is beautiful, though so foreshortened � why 
		have no more than a handful of British parties done it? Instead of a warm 
		hut on a frozen Ben, a blizzard-swept bothy miles from anywhere, you have 
		a fabulous eyrie on the Eccles, with a hot tin roof on which to toast 
		your snow-soaked feet in the afternoon. The hut is lower than expected, 
		leaving a good hour of delectable climbing to the Pic Eccles: steep snow 
		and intriguing pitches leading to one of the best of all four thousanders, 
		and a photographic orgy � it�ll be dark here in the morning. </P>
	  <P>Even for 
		the non-rock climber, our moonlit progression up perfect grade IV rock 
		to reach the sunrise at fourteen thousand feet is superbly satisfying. 
		Imperceptibly the sun assumes the moon�s task: the Fr&ecirc;ney face becomes 
		lighter than the Brouillard side. The day is still golden young when we 
		reach the horizontal ar&ecirc;te above the first step: the snow is frozen 
		hard. The crest acts as a very real handhold as I frontpoint along one 
		near-vertical side of the narrowest ridge I�ve ever seen. I�m looking 
		down to the Brouillard Glacier, not the Fr&ecirc;ney, but it�s still a 
		lot further than Observatory Gully. Pete takes the photographs with one 
		hand only... </P>
	  <P>The side 
		of the great couloir is icy, but we move together using runners on blocks 
		which protrude at convenient intervals. Sun-loosened icicles from far 
		above sweep the slopes to our left, forcing us up ice pitches among the 
		smooth rocks of the bank. Finally a crossing must be made. The ice is 
		hard at first, so much so that I can�t get my good screw in; at least 
		that serves to keep it for the middle. A front point teeter, then snow 
		reappears, and the rope just reaches the rocks before Pete has to leave 
		the first screw. A change of lead, but before long we reach the diagonal 
		couloir and have our first rest in six hours. The big red overhangs look 
		good, but it�s a long way to come for an outcrop. </P>
	  <P>It feels 
		odd to stand still, and soon it�s back to the same crampon haul from rock 
		to rock. Sooner than expected we emerge onto the rib, and the already 
		considerable exposure increases as we look straight down to the valley 
		ten thousand feet below. This upper snow, lying on ice, has been melting 
		for hours now and gets less and less pleasant. The only landmarks are 
		a fairly awkward rock step � too lazy to take crampons off � and the sagging 
		double-corniced ar&ecirc;te plugging a tributary of the main couloir. 
		We ignore a mysterious abseil loop and avoid the obstacle on the left. 
		Onward sweeps the slope; tiredness is setting in. A screw protects the 
		traverse rightwards to the blunt crest, and things are temporarily better: 
		but soon the last rocks are behind. I revert to second on the rope. which 
		though even more nerveracking in these conditions is at least less tiring. 
		</P>
	  <P>At last 
		the ridge arrives, we can rest. Nervous and physical energy alike low, 
		we nevertheless reject the dull short cut below the Courmayeur summit 
		and plough doggedly over it, admiring the great final sweep of the Peuterey, 
		the magnificence of sun and snow all round. A Himalayan trudge onto the 
		now deserted roof of Europe, a celebratory photograph, then reluctantly 
		yet joyfully down, following the litter, energy seeping back. Tea outside 
		the Vallot refreshes us for the long descent, and with only two more halts 
		we reach the valley before dark, once more exhausted but euphoric. Down 
		the road the hills seem gentler, the corners less sharp. </P>
	  <P>High above 
		us the ice is grey in the cool of the evening. </P>
