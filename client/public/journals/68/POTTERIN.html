	  <P>IT was a 
		typically chaotic prelude to the trip when I heard of the latest news 
		on reaching Delhi. One member had gone down with hepatitis the day he 
		was to fly from Sydney, and two Americans had been forced to withdraw 
		owing to an eleventh hour posting to Africa. Telegrams flashed to Bombay 
		and brought .html Australian climber onto the scene, Geoff Hill. and 
		up in Kulu valley we recruited two high altitude porters. In many ways 
		it was remarkable that we were ever able to set off, least of all with 
		a party of eight. </P>
	  <P>We drove 
		from Manali up into the Parvati valley along 50 miles of tortuous roads 
		and shortly both baggage and people were scattered liberally over a nearby 
		field. The crisis continued as first the campsite was flooded out (we 
		had no boy-scouts in the party) and secondly. we could not recruit any 
		porters. Pasang, our trusty Sherpa. disappeared up a nearby mountain on 
		a recruitment campaign and next day a rabble of 26 hillmen came to our 
		assistance. Perhaps that is the wrong word for two days later they treated 
		us to a strike and supposedly disappeared for ever. But as usually happens. 
		the lure of money brought the porters back on the fourth day and that 
		afternoon we were able to establish Base. </P>
	  <P>Base Camp 
		was situated at 12,600 ft. in the upper Malana Nullah, above the terminal 
		moraine of the Malana Glacier. It was familiar ground for Pettigrew, Henty 
		and Pritchard who had all climbed from this Base before during visits 
		to the area. But we were all able to appreciate the spectacle of the gigantic 
		rock spires, vast snow fields and twisting glaciers. Particularly prominent 
		was Ali Ratni Tibba (18,013 ft.) rising majestically above its neighbouring 
		peaks. Here indeed was a difficult mountain whose four symmetrical rock 
		faces plunged almost sheer for 4 or 5,000 ft. to the glaciers below. The 
		profile from Base lent reminiscences of the Aiguille du Dru only magnified 
		perhaps three times. </P>
	  <P>Our own 
		objective however lay out of sight above .html valley, the Tos Nullah. 
		The approach was to be over the Pass of Animals (15,025 ft.) and a further 
		day’s march to an Advance Base at 14,000 ft. on the Tos glacier. We believed 
		.html glacier (Papsura glacier) would then yield an approach to Papsura 
		(21,165 ft.), the unattempted and third highest peak of the Kulu Lahul 
		Spiti divide. Our main problem was to be the long supply line of at least 
		two days from Base over the 15,000 ft. pass to Advance Base. We decided 
		that all eight of us would ferry the loads over, to ensure our being together 
		in case of storm. It was a wise decision for we were shortly treated to 
		a three day blizzard at Base. The snow conditions in the succeeding days 
		were appalling and the whole ferrying operation took 12 days. </P>
	  <P>Just before 
		the ferrying operation was complete, Pettigrew and Pritchard ascended 
		the 1,000 ft. of moraine above Advance Base to reconnoitre a route to 
		Camp 1 (17,000 ft.). They continued across the snows and threaded a way 
		through the complex crevasses of the Papsura glacier. Faced with a doubtful 
		snow-bridge, Pritchard took a running leap across the crevasse. The short 
		jump landed him neatly in the middle of the bridge and he rapidly disappeared 
		into the yawning depths. A taut rope and a convenient snowledge brought 
		him to rest 40 ft. lower down with no more injury than a damaged pride. 
		The climbing rope of doubled Perlon line repelled all attempts to prussik 
		but the creaking ice walls seemed to urge a rapid exit. However, it was 
		over three hours before a panting and crusing Pritchard managed to climb 
		out of the obnoxious hole. The two were impressed with their first venture 
		near Papsura and returned to Advance Base for tea. </P>
	  <P>Despite 
		their mishap they had established a safe route to Camp 1 near the foot 
		of the steep rock and ice walls leading to Papsura. On May 20th the last 
		loads were ferried to Advance Base whilst a tent and equipment were left 
		at Camp 1. The weather looked threatening, and on the 21st a fierce storm 
		lashed the camps. The next morning the storm had abated and we were able 
		to flounder through the fresh snow with more loads for Camp l. As we came 
		back down, .html storm broke precipitating minor avalanches across our 
		path, but fortunately the tents were soon reached and we settled comfortably 
		inside. </P>
	  <P>The same 
		night the storm increased in fury and for 78 hours the blizzard tore at 
		the tents which were slowly buried in the snow. When the weather finally 
		cleared on May 26th, the three feet of fresh snow still chained us to 
		the camp. It was not for .html three days that we were able to move, 
		and even then progress was very trying. Pasang and Hill returned over 
		the pass to Base on skis – our food supplies had been rather reduced during 
		the storm – and the rest of us returned to Camp 1. The tent had completely 
		disappeared and it was only by pure chance that we saw the single inch 
		of tent pole protruding from the vast expanse of snow. It took two hours 
		to dig out the tattered canvas and retrieve all the buried gear, by which 
		time we were very tired. The day had painfully demonstrated how much seven 
		days of enforced inactivity reduces ones fitness. </P>
	  <P>On May 30th, 
		Pritchard, Payne and myself took a closer look at the assault route (the 
		Eastern couloir of the South face) and succeeded in placing about 500 
		ft. of fixed rope at the foot of what later became known as Avalanche 
		Couloir. We returned to Camp 1 where we found Pettigrew and Wangyal cooking 
		a splendid meal. Our large assault party of six was now ready to move 
		off the next day. The remaining two (Pasang and Hill) were now down at 
		Advance Base recovering from their ferry from Base. </P>
	  <P>We aroused 
		Wangyal at 11 p.m. that night after a minimum of sleep. By 1 a.m. on the 
		31st the six of us had eaten a large breakfast and were stumbling across 
		the Papsura glacier in almost total darkness. We reached the fixed ropes 
		after two hours and hauled ourselves up into Avalanche Couloir across 
		the small bergschrund. Up ahead Wangyal started kicking steps in the steep 
		snow and, pitch by pitch. we followed in pairs. The ever increasing panorama 
		of peaks put the physical strain out of our minds. Shortly the rising 
		sun gave a brilliant dawn display of snows in silver and red as the sky 
		changed through almost all the colours of the rainbow. A little later 
		we noticed two specks of figures moving about at Camp 1 and then advancing 
		towards the couloir. Pasang and Hill had apparently come up from Advance 
		Base and were hoping to join us on the summit attempt. </P>
	  <P>The 2,500 
		ft. of couloir seemed never ending and four hours later it still rose 
		steeply above us. We felt very insigni6cant compared with enormous rock 
		and ice buttresses which formed the imposing sides of the couloir. Over 
		two thousand feet up, the snow turned to a rotten crystalline form, underlaid 
		with a sheet of ice. Our crampons bit into the ice but progress was slow 
		and nerve racking. Ice-screws would not take for belays nor could the 
		axes be thrust in deep enough for security. At 11 a.m. we emerged exhausted 
		onto the summit ridge at about 20.000 ft. Pasang and Hill had joined us 
		and the whole expedition rested on the snow, pondering on the situation. 
		</P>
	  <P>The col 
		we had reached was poised over a drop of about 4,000 ft. to the Bare Shigri 
		glacier below. The ridge above was blocked by an enormous wall of ice 
		and further ascent promised huge cornices interspaced with rock buttresses. 
		Our hopes that the ridge would yield an easy line to the summit were dashed 
		and it was clear that all eight of us could not proceed further. Coupled 
		with this, Pasang now discovered that two of his toes were frostbitten. 
		We decided to all descend and to try .html route later. </P>
	  <P>Back down 
		in the couloir the sun had softened the deep surface snow, left by the 
		blizzard of a week ago. Hill and Pasang rushed off down first as we followed 
		more slowly in two ropes of three. Payne was suffering from the altitude 
		and twice slipped from the rotting steps, only to be held firmly by Pritchard. 
		Below the ice section he slid off again and was finally suspended upside 
		down by a rope tangle about his feet. While Pettigrew unwrapped the writhing 
		body. Wangyal, Henty and I continued down. Suddenly a roar from above 
		sent us fleeing to the side of the couloir and a large avalanche swept 
		past us – much too close for comfort. We descended even faster in fear 
		that .html would shortly come crashing down. </P>
	  <P>Near the 
		foot of the couloir we heard .html roar and horrified we saw three bodies 
		bouncing and rolling down from 1,500 ft. above. They passed below, shedding 
		oddments of kit and disappeared from sight. Already exhausted. we tried 
		to rush after them and in a few minutes found they had come to rest on 
		the edge of the bergschrund. Payne was partially buried, Pritchard slowly 
		choking from a rope wrapped round his neck, and Pettigrew in great pain 
		from a leg injury. We cut them free and helped Pritchard out from his 
		precarious snow perch inside the crevasse. At all costs we had to carry 
		Pettigrew clear of the avalanches. .html of which we expected at any 
		moment. Fortunately Pritchard and Payne soon recovered enough to help 
		in the operation but it was an hour before we had managed to move Pettigrew 
		clear. The avalanche debris made carrying very difficult and the pain 
		caused by the constant jolting must have been terrible, After .html 
		hour the casualty was inside a tent and most of the scattered equipment 
		in the couloir recovered. Pasang was at this time resting with his frostbite 
		at Camp 1, but Hill came back up with food and bedding for Pettigrew. 
		He stayed the night while the rest of us returned to Camp 1 at the end 
		of a gruelling and eventful 23 hour day. </P>
	  <P>On June 
		1st we went back up and eventually carried the injured man away from all 
		avalanche danger and back to Camp 1. The soft snow and an altitude of 
		over 17,000 ft. hindered the carry but the operation was over after only 
		6 hours. That evening it was decided that Pasang and I would rush back 
		to Manali to get both a stretcher party of porters and treatment for Pasang’s 
		frostbite. As I packed that night, I thought of our predicament: a frostbite 
		case and a suspected dislocated hip, an unconquered summit and valuable 
		equipment lost in the fall, but most of all the height of our camp which 
		was separated from Kulu valley by two high passes and a considerable mileage. 
		</P>
	  <P>We left 
		at 2,30 a.m. on the dark and cold morning of June 2nd and made excellent 
		progress. The descent to Advance Base and long haul up to the Pass of 
		Animals was over by breakfast time and we were able to bivouac well beyond 
		Base Camp that night. Another long day took us over the 11,000 ft. Chandar 
		Khanni Pass from where we ran down through the 7,000 ft. of forest to 
		reach the road 3 hours later. After initial frustration we caught the 
		last bus to reach Manali that night. By the following afternoon a team 
		of seven hillmen and a much recovered Pasang was winding its way back 
		up into the mountains. </P>
	  <P>Meanwhile, 
		the party at Camp 1 awaited the stretcher team. Hill was anxious to make 
		.html assault and persuaded Pritchard, who was now recovering from his 
		fall, to climb with him up a different couloir that would bring the pair 
		out nearer the summit. They left the camp at 2 a.m. on June 3rd and by 
		10 a.m. they had reached the top of &quot;Rolleiflex Couloir&quot; (the 
		Western couloir of the South Face) at about 20,000 ft. in excellent snow 
		conditions. They paused for a snack on some rocks before moving back down 
		a little onto the crest of the couloir. Hill tied their rucksack to the 
		rope and lowered it to Pritchard. Disastrously the knot came undone and 
		the sack plunged off down the steep couloir below, taking with it all 
		their bivouac gear, gloves and Pettigrew’s valuable Rolleiflex camera. 
		They paused to look down and then decided to rush up the remaining 800 
		ft, or so to the summit. </P>
	  <P>In Pritchard’s 
		own words: </P>
	  <P>&quot;Hill 
		led the perilous traverse of the steep, corniced crest of the couloir 
		and the next two pitches took us to the foot of an intimidating rock step. 
		This he led, again in crampons, to a fine safe stance overlooking the 
		awesome drop 5,000 ft. down to the Bara Shigri glacier. I followed with 
		difficulty and now only two steep pitches separated us from the broad 
		summit ridge. As we surmounted them, Camp 1 disappeared from our view 
		and with it the tiny cluster of figures eagerly following our progress. 
		They knew as we did, that the summit was close; they must have shared 
		our elation at the prospect of snatching success from the jaws of defeat. 
		</P>
	  <P>&quot;By 
		this time Hill was feeling effects of altitude and the strain of continuous 
		leading and he found that last stretch interminable. We reached the summit 
		at 2.30 p.m. but the view was partially obscured by storm clouds welling 
		below.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Hill and 
		Pritchard rested only briefly. for although pleased with their success 
		they were fully aware of the danger of a storm when they had no bivouac 
		equipment. In half an hour they were descending carefully. wearing one 
		glove each in the cold wind. </P>
	  <P>&quot;We 
		reached the steep section quickly and moved singly. Almost immediately 
		it began to snow and soon the visibility was down to a few yards. There 
		was little chance of losing our route, especially on the rock pitch where 
		we had left an ice screw in as protection. Now the storm was in full spate 
		and we had to shorten the pitches to make use of the leader’s rapidly 
		filling steps. Hill decided to attempt a direct descent of the difficult 
		ice section at the top of the couloir and chopped steps with gusto whilst 
		I belayed with a half-planted ice axe. Half way across, he fell out of 
		the steps and swung gracefully across the couloir. I was scared of the 
		insecure belay and terrified when he fell again. We retreated gingerly 
		to the bivouac ledge. but a night at 20,300 ft. without protection was 
		unthinkable. So we had to tackle the gendarme to regain our ascent route. 
		New powder snow overlay verglas on the rocks and I was grateful for Hill's 
		lead and top rope to safer ground. It was 6 p.m. and by now the snow conditions 
		made the couloir highly dangerous. We had to pick a way down the desperately 
		steep knife-edge of snow separating the main and subsidiary couloirs; 
		it seemed the only way of avoiding the avalanche danger. Despite the piercing 
		wind, new snow lay more than a foot deep over the old and we had to kick 
		great buckets at every step. Our ridge gave out onto rock, necessitating 
		a traverse into the minor couloir; in Rolleiflex Couloir an avalanche 
		roared down but we stopped only to shudder. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Later 
		an avalanche in our couloir piled up around us and we clung grimly to 
		our buried axes. Hill warned of the frostbite danger and I sucked my fingers. 
		He had nipped the end of his 6ngers but noticed in time to warn me and 
		prevent further damage. </P>
	  <P>&quot;We 
		were very tired and felt our way down cautiously in the gloom. Rocks appeared 
		and disappeared, vague landmarks in a sea of nothing. Nothing above save 
		unstable snow; nothing below save a gaping bergschrund; nothing to the 
		left save the shadow of a rock rib. and to the right only an indistinguishable 
		shape. Hill thought it was the bergschrund and we traversed laboriously 
		over to it – only to find .html rock rib. So we traversed back and down; 
		the slope was easier now, but our feet were like lumps of lead. It had 
		stopped snowing but our beards were frozen, duvets encrusted in snow and 
		boots unrecognisable. Downwards, always downwards until the real bergschrund 
		loomed before us, just a black line with nothing to be seen below. Hill 
		jumped and landed 20 ft. lower. My more modest leap took me almost as 
		far and I wanted to rest as I landed, never to move again. But the danger 
		was not entirely over and we had to struggle down the knee-deep avalanche 
		debris, down the snowfield and the glacier towards the pale silhouette 
		of a familiar ridge, down to the camp. There were crevasses hereabouts 
		– would we be able to see them? Better not risk it, skirt round the area, 
		come on the camp from the other side. </P>
	  <P>&quot;We 
		staggered on until we could go no further, then filled our lungs for a 
		long shout. Silence – then an answering shout not a 100 yards away. A 
		light – Wangyal almost set the tent on fire – and we trundled exhausted 
		into the welcome refuge. It was 11.30 p.m. The camp was in an uproar of 
		congratulations and relief. Water. Crampons off. Sleep.&quot; </P>
	  <P>So Papsura 
		had been climbed. On June 5th Payne and Henty left for the valley while 
		the remainder awaited the arrival of the stretcher party on June 8th. 
		This was the start of a precarious ride for Pettigrew and an exhausting 
		carry for the porters. Fixed ropes were placed above Advance Base along 
		a steep and avalanche prone traverse but progress was still difficult 
		in the soft snow. It took four days to reach Base Camp over the 15,000 
		ft. Pass of Animals, and it was a further three days over the 11,000 ft. 
		pass into the Kulu valley. On June 16th Pettigrew’s dislocated hip was 
		popped back into place in the Manali hospital and he was encased in four 
		feet of plaster from neck to toe. It was then 17 days from the time of 
		the accident – but members of the party would remember Papsura for a considerable 
		time to come. </P>
	  <P>Members 
		of expedition: R. G. Pettigrew (leader) (A.C.), C. J. Henty (Australian) 
		(H.C.), G. Hill (Australian) (N.Z.A.C.). C. Pritchard (C.U.M.C.). M. J. 
		Payne (C.U.M.C.), J. E. Ashburner (C.U.M.C.). </P>
	  <P>High altitude 
		porters: Wangyal (Ladakhi), Pasang Lakpa (Sherpa). </P>
	  <P>We regret 
		to announce that Geoffrey Hill, together with Suresh Kumar of Bombay and 
		Sherpa Pemba of Sikkin, suffocated in their small tent, in heavy snow 
		at Camp 1 (c. 15,000 ft.) overnight on about October 25<SUP>th</SUP>, 
		1967. They were attempting Mukerbeh (c. 20,000 ft.) in Kulu Himalaya.
