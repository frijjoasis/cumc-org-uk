	  <P>RAIN in 
		the Pass generally means Tremadoc. But where do you go if it’s raining 
		at Tremadoc... Portmadoc caf&eacute;?... home? Of course not; you are 
		hard and the logical thing to do is visit Hyll Drem. </P>
	  <P>As you peer 
		at the approaching cliff through the deluge pouring down the minibus windows, 
		you suddenly realise that you’re not hard after all. </P>
	  <P>&quot;What 
		do you think?&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Looks 
		manky.&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;The 
		Girdle’s supposed to be protected by the overhangs.&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Hmm. 
		Well, we can always take a look at it.&quot; </P>
	  <P>... which, 
		roughly translated, means that the pair of you are thoroughly frightened 
		at the prospect and want nothing more than to escape from the rain into 
		the beckoning caf&eacute;. </P>
	  <P>Hurrying 
		now to forget the pangs which are gripping your stomach, you trot off 
		painfully in the direction of the cliff, clad in a deceptively impressive 
		tangle of ironmongery and string. As the cliff approaches, the pangs increase 
		in intensity – a sure sign of your confidence. </P>
	  <P>... A motley 
		crowd, the C.U.M.C., and peasants all, wandering in predatory gangs around 
		the bases of crags, hurling abuse at gripped leaders; the situation looks 
		ominous when, as you rope up, half a dozen of the more prominent festerers 
		sit purposefully on the wall by the road. You want to unrope again quickly 
		when you realise that the waterfall gushing down your neck is falling 
		from the overhangs above, and that you are standing several feet from 
		the base of the climb. </P>
	  <P>At least 
		performing seals don’t feel the cold. </P>
	  <P>The ordeal 
		begins: the rock is easy to start and some of the vultures disappear to 
		fester around the corner. The crux arrives quickly and feels embarrassingly 
		thin after the glorious juggies before it. Ten minutes spent tiring yourself 
		out arranging protective devices in various unobliging orifices and all 
		you need now to complete the move is a bit of push. You bridge up and 
		lean out, And yourself in an irreversible position, and after a couple 
		of moments’ advanced grippery, you paddle and heave in the most ungainly 
		fashion around the protruding bulge. Fortunately the jams are good and 
		she goes. </P>
	  <P>The crux 
		move is done in almost a state of trance and it is a surprise to the conscious 
		to find itself above the obstacle. You put on belays with a self-satisfied 
		grin at the disappointed onlookers on the road. They look like a bevy 
		of hags around a guillotine when a would-be victim’s reprieve is announced. 
		</P>
	  <P>&quot;By 
		the way,&quot; shouts one of them (an officer of the club, with a not 
		inconsiderable record of lobs himself), &quot;you might find the next 
		move round the ar&ecirc;te hard if it’s wet.&quot; </P>
	  <P>It’s wet. 
		</P>
	  <P>To this 
		trumpet-call re-emerge the other scavenging layabouts and book their grandstand 
		seats on the wall. </P>
	  <P>&quot;Don’t 
		worry, we have every confidence in you,&quot; spoken through clenched 
		teeth with a menacing grin. </P>
	  <P>&quot;What 
		flowers would you like?&quot; </P>
	  <P>And the 
		immortal, &quot;You’re going to die!&quot; </P>
	  <P>The words 
		ring in your ears as you get further and further from your last runner. 
		The abuse rises in a crescendo from the road as it becomes increasingly 
		obvious that you are not, shall we say, entirely in control of the situation. 
		</P>
	  <P>&quot;Kindly 
		disperse, you illegitimate offspring!&quot; you reply (or words to that 
		effect). Seething with rage, you unleash some strong expressions in the 
		general direction of the rock, thereby causing it to soften, and snarl 
		your way to the top. </P>
	  <P>... Sighs 
		and groans from the road. Another downpour finally drives the onlookers 
		to the cafe. You are sorely tempted to abseil off and join them, but &quot;since 
		it’s only an easy pitch, now&quot;... </P>
	  <P>It isn’t. 
		</P>
	  <P>I have a 
		great deal of sympathy for those who, perhaps in the course of their job 
		or be it for some other reason, find themselves lay-backing on undercuts 
		up a urinal in the pouring rain; but however that may be, this was the 
		immediate prospect at the time. </P>
	  <P>... As I 
		plopped off, I saw my runner following me, but what was more alarming 
		was a stray jackal below who had seen the whole sordid incident and who 
		now ran off screaming. &quot;A lob! A goodly lob!&quot; for all to hear. 
		</P>
	  <P>At times 
		like this all you can do is finish the route with grim determination and 
		with weariness plod back to the torrents of abuse at the caf&eacute;. 
		</P>
	  <P>At such 
		a time life is meaningless. </P>
