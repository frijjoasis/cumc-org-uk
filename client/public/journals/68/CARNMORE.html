	  <P>IT 
		was pouring down on the M.5, as it nearly always does everywhere on Friday 
		nights. My windscreen wipers didn�t work. I pulled onto the hard shoulder 
		and sat swearing until the AA man knocked on the window. </P>
	  <P>He was very 
		helpful, but, as he explained, he couldn�t do anything without taking 
		the dashboard completely to pieces. </P>
	  <P>&quot;You�ll 
		have to manage without. Are you going far?&quot; </P>
	  <P>&quot;Inverness.&quot; 
		</P>
	  <P>From the 
		look on his face I guessed that I must be the first person ever to go 
		from Worcestershire to Northern Scotland. </P>
	  <P>The rain 
		eventually stopped and I got to Manchester only about three hours late. 
		Gordon, Bob and Eddie were on their fifth or sixth pints. Peter Rowat, 
		frustrated from going to Carnmore again himself, was telling them what 
		lines to climb, and how, and what to call them. and why. and no-one was 
		listening. I bought his pack frame and gradually moved the others out 
		of the Guild. Happily it didn�t rain again until we arrived. </P>
	  <P>Inverness 
		was bought out of porridge and sticky milk and sausages and other goodies, 
		and we reached Poolewe at opening time. It was drizzling and the mist 
		was down over the sea. </P>
	  <P>&quot;What 
		are we waiting for?&quot; asked Bob. </P>
	  <P>Tomorrow, 
		we told him. So we cooked ourselves a midge risotto and slept in a horrible 
		shed and miraculously tomorrow was dry. We drove inland up a road labelled 
		&quot;No Entry&quot; and came after a couple of miles to a locked gate 
		and nasty man. Regrettably we had no permits. </P>
	  <P>&quot;You 
		can�t park here.&quot; </P>
	  <P>Just like 
		London. We unloaded the sacks and I took the car back onto the next estate 
		where no-one was watching. </P>
	  <P>The walk 
		into Carnmore is about seven miles, reasonably level and furnished with 
		bits of path. The views of the Loch Maree hills, close up on one side, 
		and countless lochans spread out on the other, are excellent. It would 
		make a very pleasant afternoon, if you had nothing to carry � or, I suppose, 
		if you were fit. For us it was hard work. Eddie was sure his sack was 
		the heaviest. It was certainly the smallest, but then we had given him 
		all the tins, so he might just have been right. </P>
	  <P>After about 
		two hours, when my knees were beginning to sag, we came down to the Fionn 
		Loch by the &quot;Little Crag&quot;. This. the first real cliff we�d seen, 
		was impressively steep, but it didn�t quite live up to Bob Keates� four 
		hundred feet. I wondered momentarily whether we could divide all his other 
		figures by two. </P>
	  <P>Fortunately 
		the Ghost Slabs round the corner were no disappointment, a thousand feet 
		high at least. And by now we could see across the loch to the real thing, 
		Carnmore Crag. Along the sandy shore, across the causeway, a last desperate 
		uphill section � all of fifty feet � and we were at the barn. </P>
	  <P>Col. Whitbread�s 
		shooting lodge looked attractive, but as uninvited guests we felt we could 
		only use the stable. This, however, was very comfortable. Two feet of 
		dry manure made a good mat- tress and there was even a table. We brewed 
		up and looked at the crag. Almost five o�clock � just about time for a 
		quick route, we thought. Gordon and Bob chose Dragon, and Eddie and I 
		went to do Gob, as these looked to be the best of the existing routes 
		that we knew of. </P>
	  <P>We rather 
		forgot that the cliff was in two tiers and that both these routes were 
		at the top. We had to do something to get up there, and just what Eddie 
		and I did I�m not sure. It was a rather nondescript bit of rock which 
		may well have been unclimbed. and it was quite pleasant. Steep granity 
		rock, but none of the nasty featurelessness of Cornwall or Chamonix � 
		lines of lovely pockets appeared at just the right moments. The crag was 
		almost perfectly dry, the sun was still full on it. and the ledges were 
		full of blue and yellow flowers � a change from plain Welsh grass. </P>
	  <P>Three pitches 
		took us to the big bay in the middle of the crag. The top two were quite 
		steep in places: not dramatic climbing, but it gave us some idea of what 
		could be done on this accommodating rock. </P>
	  <P>Gob took 
		a very satisfying geometric line: out along a big slot, up in a groove, 
		left for a long pitch under the big roof, then through it by .html corner 
		groove and up to the top. The rock confirmed our first impressions: pockets 
		again, just as you needed them; otherwise mostly incut or sharp flat holds; 
		lots of little runners. threads and spillikins and nut-holes; and a steepness 
		that was enough but not uncivilised. </P>
	  <P>This, at 
		any rate, was true of the middle of the upper wall. On either side, it 
		was clear, things were a bit different. Out on the left, beyond Dragon, 
		were some very steep grooves, the line of Abomination, a Creag Dhu route 
		which looked decidedly uncivilised. Dragon too had its awkward bits, we 
		were informed as we waited at the top of the crag at ten o�clock. </P>
	  <P>On the right-hand 
		side of the upper crag was the dreaded Red Corner � dearly the last great 
		problem of the cliff, and the focus of Peter Rowat�s daydreams for a whole 
		year. He had abseiled down it the summer before, and despite losing all 
		contact with both walls after the first ten feet, he was sure it would 
		go free. </P>
	  <P>&quot;It 
		only overhangs twenty feet, and there�s a good fist-jamming crack � in 
		the middle.&quot; </P>
	  <P>When Peter 
		found he was unable to come with us, his enthusiasm reached even greater 
		levels. He drew us a diagram indicating a &quot;stance&quot; in the middle, 
		where a spidery creature crouched in a faint depression in the overhanging 
		wall, attached by forces that were difficult to imagine. Geoff Cram, who 
		had been up a few weeks earlier, had actually tried the corner and had 
		soon formed his own opinion. Peter, however, was undaunted � on our behalf. 
		He thought we might need a peg. </P>
	  <P>Faced by 
		all this encouragement, we felt we had to try. Fortunately the corner 
		was still wet, so we reckoned we had a couple of days grace. </P>
	  <P>But this 
		is digressing. To return to the top of the crag at ten p.m., the striking 
		thing was that we were still in shirtsleeves � and sunshine. Eddie and 
		I just sat and looked � at the grass, the sky, the lochans, the colours, 
		the crags. Rock everywhere. The slabs across the Dubh loch, in two big 
		fans coming down from a black bulging upper tier, at least a thousand 
		feet in all though some parts were a bit jungly. To their left in the 
		shadows, a Big Black Wall, very steep, totally unclimbed and intriguing. 
		On the near side, across the descent gully, was Torr na h�Iolaire with 
		about four Grochans, one on top of the other, or so it appeared to a casual 
		glance. (Looking up the old guide, we found that they were fairly gentle 
		Grochans.) Further up the valley were more cliffs again, so we understood 
		from Bob and Peter. It seemed that a week would not go very far. </P>
	  <P>When we 
		had finished eating it was just too dark to read. We sat around, expecting 
		it to get fully dark. When the halflight was still there at half past 
		one we realised that it just wouldn�t, so we went to bed. For me one of 
		the best things about Carnmore was being able to stay in bed till lunchtime 
		and still get a full day�s climbing. </P>
	  <P>New routes 
		were the form next day. I had a line on the upper crag, right up the middle, 
		starting out of a cave between Dragon and Gob, crossing the Gob traverse 
		and taking a slightly hopeful line through the big overhang. Gordon and 
		Bob bad schemes away on the left. </P>
	  <P>Again it 
		seemed a pity not to climb on the lower tier, so Eddie and I found a nice 
		little line there � to warm up on, we thought. On the right of the lower 
		tier was a set of overlapping slabs, the site of .html of Peter�s good 
		ideas. His drawing showed an eight foot roof, split by a hairline crack 
		and labelled &quot;crux, may need a peg&quot;. Fortunately we found a 
		cunning traverse, above this roof and below the next, which solved things 
		very neatly. It led off along a steep flake, whose edge formed monstrous 
		jugs. then a peculiar wall where the pockets only just sufficed and gave 
		some superb moves: great fingery swings alternating with delicate balancy 
		foot-shufflings. A peculiar step round a minor overlap led onto the lip 
		of the big lower roof, which had appeared from the start to be a pretty 
		thin slab. When I reached it the benevolent pockets were so big that it 
		was no more than an exposed walk. </P>
	  <P>I belayed 
		on a tongue of flowery grass in the central groove and Eddie came up and 
		led through. Thirty feet above was .html overlap with a groove above 
		it. The slabs between looked a bit bare but again the pockets kept turning 
		up. A good move over the overlap and out right onto the top slabs in sunshine 
		and flowers; it was good to be alive. We called the route Penny Lane: 
		it had a sort of dreamy quality. </P>
	  <P>We had expected 
		to go straight on from here to the upper tier, but now .html crag. which 
		we hadn�t even noticed, forced itself upon us: the Grey Wall. A little 
		line was found up a cracked ar&ecirc;te � very steep, this one, but so 
		well supplied with jugs that it was quite reasonable. Eddie�s pitch was 
		really steep with some peculiar flakes that were not obviously attached 
		to anything but still perfectly solid. Again the cliff was accommodating. 
		</P>
	  <P>This brought 
		us out below the Red Corner, still wet, so we traversed across into the 
		lush shadowy grass below my line. By now it was five o�clock � but what 
		did it matter? </P>
	  <P>The crack 
		started as a cave, twenty feet high and with no obvious big holds to get 
		you out at the top. As a first approach, we thought we�d traverse in from 
		the left just above the cave, so we climbed up a dirty groove to reach 
		a stance on a heather ledge next to Dragon. Eddie took a belay and I looked 
		at the options. </P>
	  <P>The lowest 
		traverse line was reasonable at first, but it soon gave out into steep 
		blankness where the wall heeled over into the cave. Ten feet higher was 
		.html line and this looked much better. Again the rock was perfect: 
		just on balance, little sharp flinty holds, and still in sunshine. </P>
	  <P>I moved 
		out onto a rib, but here for once Carnmore let me down. I wanted to step 
		down. then across right to a ledge, but there were no handholds, and it 
		was a very big step. It was such a pity � two moves, and I was sure it 
		would be reasonable again. I could see spikes and nice ledges. </P>
	  <P>On such 
		a helpful crag there had to be a solution. I looked around and saw a big 
		natural thread, just sticking out of the wall about twenty feet above 
		me. If I can fix a runner there. I thought. a little tension might do 
		it. I climbed up a vague crack to the higher level and got hold of the 
		thread. Half of it broke off in my hand but the other half made a spike 
		and seemed quite solid. I went down again. and further down on the rope 
		to the vital foothold. Moving right to the ledges was very odd. Tension 
		had to be supplemented by fingernail-sized underpulls behind a little 
		roof to prevent me swinging out. Eddie juggled the ropes very expertly 
		and I reached a resting place. </P>
	  <P>The next 
		section was easier. then a short awkward wall led to the main break and 
		I found myself bridged across the top of the cave. contorted to avoid 
		some unsupported blocks. Coming straight up did look hard. </P>
	  <P>From here 
		to the traverse line of Gob was about eighty feet. The crack was never 
		desperate but it stayed interesting all the way. I passed one enormous 
		loose block. narrowly escaped pulling it off in my arms, and then resisted 
		temptation � one of the ropes was directly below it, and it was mine. 
		The stance at the top was two footholds and a peg crack, and there was 
		about six feet of rope left. </P>
	  <P>At this 
		point I remembered that Eddie had no hammer, (In fact he had no gear at 
		all, except a sort of suspender belt full of loops and rings to hold all 
		the pegs and karabiners he hadn�t got. He had no P.A.s either � he regretted 
		that.) He tried knocking out the belay peg with stones, but he could only 
		find little ones, so he had to leave it. </P>
	  <P>It seemed 
		a good idea for him to put the rope directly round the spike to avoid 
		leaving a sling. Unfortunately it stuck, and he found himself in mid-traverse. 
		unable to move and being sworn at. His reply was short and to the point. 
		He had to go back and leave a sling, but when he came across again he 
		was so shattered he swung off altogether and a big pull just averted disaster. 
		He shifted the loose block, leaving a crater in the grass and a smell 
		of burning whatsit in the air. It nearly hit the barn. </P>
	  <P>By the time 
		Eddie reached the stance it was half past eight. Bob and Gordon. out of 
		sight round the corner, had already finished. I was feeling pretty tired 
		but I was sure that if we didn�t finish the route that night, the weather 
		or some other fate would prevent us coming back. So we looked at the next 
		pitch, a short corner, continuing the crack line and splitting the big 
		roof, which here was offset a few feet. </P>
	  <P>From the 
		stance I could step up a couple of moves. Out to the right was a niche, 
		in the back of the corner, which seemed to be a good resting place. Its 
		floor was formed by a block, and if I could reach that I was halfway there, 
		A tape sling on a spikelet gained me a couple of feet � I was almost level 
		with the block but too far to the left. Five or six times I came down, 
		reknotted the sling to a slightly different length, and tried again. Really 
		this was pointless as there was nothing at all to go for. But I was tired 
		in mind as well as fingers and I hadn�t any other ideas. </P>
	  <P>Finally 
		the crucial handhold broke as I was moving up, and I very nearly fell 
		off. The shock woke me up and I came down to the stance for a think. I 
		could still see no way of progressing free, so I tried to place a peg, 
		in a crack below the block and miles to the right of my sling. Frantic 
		leanings-over brought this just within reach, and, in peril of turning 
		upside down, I clawed away a mass of green hair � reminiscent of Anglesey 
		� and poked the peg in. Attempts to hold it and hit it at the same time 
		were almost disastrous, but eventually it went right in. </P>
	  <P>As I hadn�t 
		been able to see the peg crack at all I just had to move across on hope. 
		Fortunately the crack was good. and I reached the block. The promised 
		resting place was useless so I moved on towards the ar&ecirc;te on very 
		small footholds. </P>
	  <P>Just before 
		the ar&ecirc;te the holds became a bit too small but by then I was committed, 
		mentally at least. I pulled out on some indifferent things and stepped 
		onto a very poor hold on the edge. Calves were quivering, and I groped 
		urgently for a big jug. The cliff didn�t fail me a third time � my hand 
		fell into a beauty, and I was up. </P>
	  <P>This time 
		I could lower the hammer to Eddie, so we lost no more gear. I hauled the 
		sack up before he came so he didn�t find this pitch too bad. He�d compared 
		the previous pitch to Vector, but wearing boots and carrying the sack 
		(which contained my boots) may have influenced him. </P>
	  <P>The top 
		pitch was easy, even for cramped arms. and we emerged at ten-thirty to 
		see a Brocken spectre on a patch of mist in the gully. We coiled the ropes 
		and screeched down through the mist to supper and endless brews and competitive 
		exaggerations. </P>
	  <P>After a 
		day like this we couldn�t help an anticlimax. Again we got up at lunchtime 
		and again we looked at the Red Corner. But it was still wet. and besides, 
		the day was cold and windy. Bob and Gordon went up again and found two 
		more lines near to our first two of the day before. (It is rumoured that 
		their route on the Grey Wall is impossible if you�re shorter than six 
		feet three.) We went to look for the Gritstone Buttresses of A�Mhaighdean, 
		and found them, after a long search, situated at the top of an almighty 
		grass slope. We, of course, were at the bottom. </P>
	  <P>The line 
		we tried was a good one � a corner leading up to a bit of a roof and continuing 
		above, but here, although the geometry of the cliff was again satisfying, 
		the rock was nasty: brittle conglomerate like perverted inedible treacle 
		toffee. We were foiled by the roof � there just wasn�t quite enough over 
		the top � and we had to be content with a big bottleneck chimney in the 
		middle of the crag, into which we cunningly traversed, avoiding the bottle 
		part. We didn�t fancy any more and it was freezing cold, so we went for 
		a walk. </P>
	  <P>When we 
		returned to the barn the clans were gathering. One kilted hairy Scotsman 
		had lit a fire out in the open, in scorn of our primuses. It transpired 
		that he was no less than a full member of the S.M.C. </P>
	  <P>As we cooked 
		our supper the big guns appeared: John Cunningham, Ronnie Marshall and 
		two apprentices. You could almost see the Red Corner shaking as they looked 
		at it. We made plans to start at dawn, but the weather beat everyone. 
		It rained steadily for three days. and when it stopped alcohol starvation 
		drove us all home. I read &quot;A Town Like Alice&quot; at least twice 
		before it was needed for more urgent purposes. </P>
	  <P>Those three 
		days were by no means wasted. There was some interesting verbal fencing 
		over the merits and grades of Wales and Glencoe, (if you�re interested, 
		the Bat is &quot;a wee bit harder than Sickle&quot;,) and first hand accounts 
		of great steigs in the Coe, I�ve been trying ever since to imitate Cunningham 
		imitating Whillans. </P>
	  <P>And it isn�t 
		every week that you get the chance to lie undisturbed in a dung-heap for 
		three days. </P>
