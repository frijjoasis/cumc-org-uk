	  <P>THE first 
		milestone on my way to the hills was passed when I crossed the Helyg threshold, 
		out of a typical December night and into that atmosphere of warmth and 
		welcome which, perhaps through being derived from contrast, is only to 
		be found in a climbing hut. It was my first meet with the C.U.M.C., and 
		I was a complete novice so far as rock- climbing was concerned. It did 
		not take long for the basic principles of the sport to be driven home, 
		and First Pinnacle Rib made a good introductory climb, where belays and 
		stances could be explained and demonstrated at leisure. Then I was taken 
		up the Terrace Wall Variant. Time erases much, but the recollection of 
		being hauled ignominiously up the last twenty feet still lingers, as also 
		does that of looking down from the top of the third pitch, and learning 
		the meaning of exposure. However, it is a commonplace that the weather 
		conditions can almost change the very configuration of the rocks; and 
		six months later, on a hot June day when rubbers were the only wear, the 
		holds seemed to have grown like mushrooms, and the exposure to have become 
		almost negligible. </P>
	  <P>The December 
		meet in 1941 did not produce any weather like this, and every day we looked 
		in vain for a glimpse of Adam and Eve through the heavy clouds which veiled 
		the summit of Tryfan. The Tryfan buttresses were popular, being sheltered 
		from the prevailing gales, but my most vivid memories are of climbing 
		on the Glyders. On one such occasion, Gordon Donaldson led two of us up 
		the Chasm on a day when every rock had its own particular waterfall, and 
		even the chasm itself gave us no shelter. Ever since, Glyder Fach has 
		been associated in my mind with a swirling grey mist obliterating everything 
		but fleeting glimpses of Llyn Bochlwyd, windswept and greyer than the 
		mist, and enclosed on all sides by forlorn screes and boulder-strewn desolation. 
		Another occasion, more pleasant to look back on than to experience, was 
		an expedition over thc Glyders in mist and sleet, when an error in map 
		and compass work brought the party down into the Llanberis valley instead 
		of Cwm Idwal, and the eight-mile walk back along the road through Pen-y-pass 
		and Capel Curig was only made possible by the thought of warmth and supper 
		awaiting us at Helyg. </P>
	  <P>On my second 
		visit, in company with Edward Wormell and Rick Goody, the whole face of 
		the landscape was changed. What had been grey forbidding crags had become 
		warm and friendly rocks, inviting a closer acquaintance, if only for the 
		purpose of basking awhile in the sun they so efficiently trapped. The 
		standards of difficulty seemed to have dropped to a remark- able degree, 
		while the long summer days seemed to fix no limit to the number of climbs 
		that could be accomplished in one day. The Original Route on Holly Tree 
		Wall gave us something to think about on the first day, the first move 
		on the first pitch being only overcome by combined tactics involving the 
		whole party. Zig-zag also we found none too easy, and the efforts of Edward 
		and Rick in the crack on the second pitch attracted more than one onlooker 
		from passers by on the path to Cwm Idwal; it was 6nally done in stockings, 
		when we found that the main difficulty is a psychological one, due to 
		the fact that the leader is out of sight of his second at the crucial 
		point. We visited Craig yr Ysfa, when Amphitheatre Buttress, a descent 
		of Great Gully, and a somewhat vegetaceous route on Great Gully Buttress 
		gave us an excellent day, though the last-mentioned can hardly be recommended 
		except as a test of faith; this, however, its steep heather-and-grass 
		pitches provide in full measure. There can be few other crags in the Idwal 
		district which can offer such’ fine unbroken walls as those of Great Gully 
		and the Amphitheatre, or such entertaining situations as the knife-edge 
		ridge on Amphitheatre Buttress, and it is a little surprising that these 
		cliffs have been relatively so neglected in the past. Perhaps the long 
		ascent of Pen Helyg or the col above Fynnon Llugwy provides an explanation. 
		</P>
	  <P>One of the 
		most attractive features of climbing in the Ogwen district in summer is 
		the possibility of expeditions late in the evening to the Gribin or Bochlwyd 
		Buttress, where one climbs at glorious leisure, continually pausing to 
		look back, to see Y Garn and Pen yr Oleu Wen with their tops caught by 
		the setting sun, and the Nant Ffrancon valley stretching away in the haze 
		to the sea, over which; perhaps, the outline of Anglesea is just discernible. 
		And one’s appreciation of such visions is only heightened by the knowledge 
		that these same hills and valleys can present such a different picture 
		under other conditions. Bristly Ridge with the wind whistling through 
		its pinnacles, the Devil’s Kitchen cliffs dripping water from every crack 
		and crevice, or the Carnedds, dimly seen across the valley through sheets 
		of driving rain, all remind the climber of the emptiness of a mere fair-weather 
		friendship with the mountains, and of the wrong he does them when he talks 
		of&quot; the changeless hills.&quot; </P>
	  <P>In December 
		1942 club was again unlucky with the weather, and the days of continuous 
		wind and rain were reflected in the hut log book by monotonous accounts 
		of climbs on Milestone Buttress, Tryfan East Face, and Milestone Buttress 
		again. We consoled ourselves with the thought that the actual achievements 
		of the meet were of small importance compared with the growth of friendship 
		and mutual confidence which hut life fosters. It cannot be denied that 
		a week of it will go far towards perfecting one’s skill in drying the 
		maximum number of clothes before a minimum of fire – and this is by no 
		means the least part of the art of mountaineering. An attempt at camping 
		with Ronnie Lloyd near Idwal Cottage the following June was defeated by 
		the swamp which our site soon became, and we had to retreat into the hostel 
		itself. However, between storms we got two good days’ climbing; on one, 
		by doing Hope on the Slabs, followed by the Ar4te on Continuation Wall, 
		and finally the Central Ar&ecirc;te on the Upper Cliff, we got more or 
		less continuous climbing the whole way to the top of Glyder Fawr. The 
		Central Ar0te becomes rather unpleasantly loose near the top, and it was 
		perhaps with some relief that we arrived at the summit, to be rewarded 
		with an excellent view of the who1e Snowdon group, and beyond it, of Moel 
		Hebog and Yr Eifl. The other notable day was spent on an ascent of Tryfan 
		by Ivy Chimney on the Milestone and Gashed Crag. We decided that the window 
		on Ivy Chimney merits more respect than the guide-book would seem to indicate 
		in classifying the climb as &quot;moderately difficult,&quot; We spent 
		most of the remainder of our time vainly tapping the hostel’s barometer. 
		</P>
	  <P>The last 
		C.U.M.C. meet at Helyg came as a fitting conclusion to two years of climbing 
		and walking in Wales. An East wind brought frost and sun, enough of the 
		former to freeze the hut’s water supply, but not enough to put more than 
		a trace of ice on the rocks. The dry conditions made rubbers practicable, 
		and in consequence a number of climbs of a good standard were done, while 
		the sun and clarity of the air gave newcomers to Wales the best possible 
		conditions in which to see the district for the first time. Some adventurous 
		spirits even found that one could skate on Llyn Idwal in clinkers. Such 
		conditions were an obvious invitation to visit Snowdon, and accordingly, 
		after a pleasant cycle ride to Pen-y-Pass, two of us set off up the long 
		pyramid of Crib Goch, as the first stage of the Snowdon Horseshoe. Once 
		on the ridge, we were greeted by a view of the entrancing summit triangle 
		Y Wyddfa, which has been more than once likened by the fanciful to the 
		summit cone of Everest with the ridge leading down to the North Col; while 
		across Llyn Llydaw the dark face of Lliwedd, in shadow, looted infinitely 
		vast. Time did not permit us to remain long admiring this prospect, and 
		the ridge of Crib-y-Ddisgyl stretched invitingly ahead, The first part 
		of this ridge well deserves its fame, and the sensational drop into Cwm 
		Glas is only offset by the gentler slopes facing Lliwedd. From the crest 
		of Carnedd Ugain to the summit, a thin mantle of snow gave a pleasant 
		Alpine touch to the scene. From the summit, one could see the whole district 
		as far south as the familiar outline of Cader Idris, while beyond Cnicht 
		only the mountain tops showed above a sea of cloud, tinged with pink by 
		the setting sun. Away in the direction of Anglesea, only the rolling mist 
		was to be seen, with spurs and shoulders of our own mountain plunging 
		down into obscurity: yet so thin was it that, although of the sea itself 
		we could see nothing, the sun’s reflection in the sea was plainly visible 
		through it. The setting sun reminded us of the more material necessities 
		of life, as we could not stop long on the top if we were to be over Lliwedd 
		before dark. We reached its summit just as the pinnacles of Crib Goch 
		were catching the last rays of sunlight, and struck the miners’ track 
		as the gathering darkness was beginning to make the rough going difficult. 
		</P>
	  <P>Another 
		glorious day drew us irresistibly to the Carnedds, and after the long 
		plod up the slopes of Pen Helyg, we were rewarded with a magnificent view 
		of Craig yr Ysfa, with every detail of the rock picked out in brilliant 
		sunshine. A short halt was made here for photography, when the demand 
		for a foreground led to an interesting comparison of our various and picturesque 
		attires, and then we crossed the exhilarating narrow ridge which connects 
		Pen Helyg with Craig yr Ysfa and the Carnedds. After respectfully admiring 
		the Great Gully from its top, we set off up the final slopes of Carnedd 
		Llewellyn, to reach its summit in time to get the view before a dense 
		bank of cloud rolled up from inland, and reduced visibility to a matter 
		of a few yards. We went on over the top of Ysgolion Duon, or Black Ladders, 
		whose walls of dripping, vegetaceous black rock looked as though they 
		could only attract misanthropes wishing to depart this world, and their 
		rescue parties. From the top of Carnedd Dafydd, a line of cairns led us 
		over Pen-yr-Oleu-Wen, and eventually to the cheerful atmosphere of the 
		Ogwen Cottage tea room. </P>
	  <P>Two other 
		views of Wales will live for a long time to come. One is of the upper 
		thousand feet of the North ridge of Tryfan with its gaunt rock towers 
		and pinnacles plastered with icicles, when the ice and snow on the path 
		required a degree of care contrasting markedly with the casual way in 
		which one usually comes down off the mountain by this route. The other 
		is that from the top of Y Garn at sunset, when all but the upper few hundred 
		feet of the higher mountains was submerged in a solid but friendly mass 
		of white cloud; each peak, brilliantly lit up by the setting sun, threw 
		its shadow on the cloud: while all that penetrated from below was the 
		unobtrusive sound of the Ogwen Falls. </P>
	  <P>Once again 
		the time came to take leave of Wales, and again as the train left behind 
		it the friendly outline of the Carnedds, there came a feeling of emptiness, 
		as when one says good-bye to a friend. But, whether the friend is in the 
		peaceful bracken and heather covered slopes of the foothills of Cnicht, 
		undulating their way upwards from the still, wooded shores of Llyn Dinas 
		and Llyn Gwynant, or in the grim rugged circle of Cwm Idwal, with a foreground 
		of windswept lake and lashing rain, he is always present, to be recalled 
		in the silent moments of everyday life; and, as he comes to life, one 
		cannot but vow to visit again this land of so many contrasts. </P>
