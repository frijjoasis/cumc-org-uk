		<H1>The History of the C.U.M.C.</H1><HR>
		<H2>G. R. Hervey</H2>
		<H3>King's</H3>
  
	  <P>EVERY institution 
		of any age has its legends, and the C.U.M.C. is no exception. Indeed, 
		dating back, as it does, well into the &quot; pre-last war &quot; period, 
		and having a gap of several years in its history, during the war period, 
		when, incidentally, its written records were lost, it is singularly well 
		placed to have them. While, however, other institutions may make of their 
		legends a source of legitimate pride, when we see our own seriously quoted, 
		from our own columns, we hasten to admit, the time has clearly come to 
		dissipate the myth. The club has therefore every reason to be grateful 
		to Geoffrey Winthrop Young, the president of the Alpine Club, for establishing 
		its true early history and placing with it the documentation and his own 
		record, upon which the following account is based, and is here published 
		for the first time. </P>
	  <P>The Revd. 
		A. Valentine Richards, dean of Christ’s, was a very good and generous 
		friend to the C.U.M.C. after his return to Cambridge as a don. His memory 
		was, however, fallible. At the meeting summoned to reconstitute the club 
		after the war, in 1920, he made a statement, vaguely reported and rather 
		diffidently inserted in the new minute book; and he appears to have amplified 
		this orally. to members of the club not long before his death, in 1934. 
		It is this statement which found its way into an article in our 1922 Journal 
		and into the editorial of the 1934 Journal, whence it has been copied 
		by the Alpine Journal, the American Alpine Journal, etc.; and so the legend 
		began. </P>
	  <P>It ran as 
		follows: the dub was founded in 1883, its foundation being &quot; largely 
		due&quot; to Mr. Valentine Richards; and it was confined at first to Trinity 
		College, and later extended to include members of other colleges. We are 
		left to assume that it was never known as anything but the C.U.M.C., a 
		University club. The 1934 Journal also contains Mr. Valentine Richards’ 
		obituary. From this we learn that he came up from Shrewsbury to Christ’s 
		in 1885; and, therefore, that while a boy of, say, sixteen, at school, 
		he was &quot;largely responsible&quot; for the starting in Trinity College 
		of a club for undergraduates of that college, to which he would seem to 
		have little prospect of belonging himself when he should come up two years 
		later to Christ’s! Among these contradictions, the date 1883 may perhaps 
		have suggested itself in order to allow time for the club to develop, 
		out of an exclusively Trinity one, into one which would allow of Mr. Valentine 
		Richards’ belonging to it in 1885. But in meeting one difficulty, the 
		suggestion involves .html contradiction, in that it renders it wholly 
		impossible for Mr. Richards to have been in any degree responsible for 
		the founding of the club. Our predecessors, in publishing these inconsistencies, 
		missed an engaging opportunity of evolving a &quot;Little Saint Valentine&quot; 
		as the boy-founder of the club. </P>
	  <P>Further, 
		Geoffrey Winthrop Young came up himself to Trinity in 1894, and there 
		came to know every past and present Cambridge mountaineer, from the pioneer 
		generation onwards. Not one of them had ever heard of such a dub, much 
		less belonged to it, attended a meeting, or come down to lecture to it. 
		In fact, no other member of such a club has ever been traced or heard 
		of. Moreover, until the spread of English climbing, which did not come 
		until the turn of the century, such a club <I>could not</I>, by the nature 
		of things, have been started or maintained among undergraduates. Mountaineering 
		before that meant only <I>Alpine</I> mountaineering: very few undergraduates 
		could afford to go to the Alps; and none would have dreamed that his &quot; 
		experience &quot; was sufficient to talk about in public or to ground 
		a club upon. Indeed, after 1900, Mr. Young was in correspondence with 
		Charles Sayle, the popular assistant University Librarian, who had helped 
		to found the English Climbers’ Club in 1899, about the possibility of 
		starting a club in Cambridge as a branch of the E.C.C,; and the latter 
		stated definitely as a result of a discussion between officials of the 
		E.C.C. and the few undergraduate climbers in residence, that he thought 
		the time was not yet ripe and the University not ready even then. Mr. 
		Young assisted in starting the English Climbers’ Club in 1899, the Cambridge 
		University Alpine Club in 1910, and the Oxford University Mountaineering 
		Club in 1912, and in his view the C.U.M.C. was in fact founded at the 
		very earliest moment at which such an organisation among undergraduates 
		became practicably possible. The doubts which he felt even in 1906 were 
		borne out by its rather frail life; till it flickered out in 1914. It 
		has required the changed attitude to climbing, and the altered social 
		conditions after the last war, to enable its vigorous existence since. 
		</P>
	  <P>To come 
		now to the facts. The Cambridge University Mountaineering Club was founded 
		– under that name – during the winter months of 1905-1906. It was founded 
		by Hugh Stewart and W. J. R. Calvert, both of whom were scholars of Trinity 
		College. The list of original members, so far as it can be reconstructed 
		from old letters and menus, seems to have included: – W. J. R. Calvert 
		(<I>first President</I>), Hugh Stewart (<I>first Hon. Secretary</I>), 
		H. B. Pilkington, E. F. Pilkington, C. R. Barran, H. C. Wilkinson, (<I>all 
		of Trinity</I>), J. G. Drummond (<I>of Christ’s</I>), A. H. Ramsay (<I>of 
		Pembroke</I>), and N. L. Cappell. In addition, the following were present 
		at the first annual dinner: – J. W. Reynolds, F. W. Hubback, W. B. S. 
		Angus, R. H, Verney, W. P. Hulton, F. A; Powell, C. C. Kerby, G. B. Lloyd 
		and C. A. Tower (or Jones?); and at the second annual dinner: – R. C. 
		Lundie, P. Haslehurst, E. C. Rayner, J. H. Mandleburg and W. McMaster(P): 
		and of these no doubt a number were also members. The first lecture was 
		given by Sir Martin Conway, as he then was, on February 14th, 1906; and 
		he was afterwards entertained to dinner by the club in A. H. Ramsay’s 
		rooms. There had however been less formal meetings before this, and at 
		the first, which was probably in December, 1905, Calvert read a paper 
		on the Alps, where he had already had some experience. The second lecturer 
		from outside the club was W. Cecil Slingsby; and the third, in the autumn 
		of 1906, was G. Winthrop Young. The first annual dinner took place on 
		May 19th, 1906; and the second, on May 1st, 1907. The guest and speaker 
		at the second was the Revd. L. S. Calvert, W. R. Calvert’s father, a well-known 
		mountaineer, and member of the Alpine Club. Menus from both these dinners 
		have now been presented to the Club by one of the original members, E. 
		F. Pilkington, who was himself son of the great Alpine pioneer Charles 
		Pilkington, and father of our recent Hon. Secretary, Charles Pilkington. 
		They are of interest apart from their historical value and that of the 
		signatures they carry. That of the second dinner was in French and decorated 
		with a coloured photograph of the Piz Rosegg, suggesting the growing prosperity 
		of the club; and Hugh Stewart, the Hon. Secretary, signs his name with 
		a spirited flourish, evidently rejoiced at the success of the venture. 
		Included on the menu on both occasions were salmon, whitebait, roast lamb, 
		asparagus and chocolate souffl&eacute;; the repetition witnesses to the 
		Hon. Secretary’s preferences! </P>
	  <P>Of meets 
		in these early days we have no record. There were then no Youth Hostels 
		or climbing club huts, and organised meets as we know them would probably 
		have been very difficult to arrange; especially while English climbing 
		was still some- thing of a novelty, and the ambitions of all serious members 
		fixed on the Alps. It would appear that at this stage the club did no 
		more in this direction than enable young climbers to get to know each 
		other, leaving the actual climbing parties to be privately arranged. The 
		encouragement ’ and assistance which the dub received from senior members, 
		then as now, was invaluable, and without it the club could probably not 
		have existed at all. </P>
	  <P>During the 
		war, as related, the club activities ceased. Kenneth Tallerman, now Colonel 
		Tallerman, R.A.M.C., was the last Hon. Sec. to be elected, in August, 
		1914, the appointment to take effect in October. He relates that at this 
		time the club met regularly in Mr. Valentine Richards’ rooms in Christ’s, 
		coffee and biscuits being provided, and it remained a purely undergraduate 
		dub, although as’ far as he recollects Mr. Richards seemed to be acting 
		as president. On the outbreak of war, however, both Tallerman and C. G. 
		Crawford, the out-going secretary, later Himalayan and Everest explorer, 
		left for the front; the minute books, or book, were never transferred, 
		and disappeared; and from this confusion has arisen our ignorance of the 
		early history of the club, and its substituted legend. </P>
	  <P>After the 
		war, the club was completely reconstituted, largely on the initiative 
		of C. A. Elliot, tutor of Jesus, Alpine Club member, and now headmaster 
		of Eton, and of Mr. Valentine Richards. Among the undergraduates, George 
		Metcalfe, of Jesus, took a leading part. The club passed through a number 
		of rapid constitutional changes, including a brief interlude when there 
		were some lady members, and emerged much in its present form; its active 
		officers drawn from undergraduates, with continuity and tradition safeguarded 
		by a small committee of older resident mountaineers. W. T. Elmslie, of 
		Westminster College, the Ellwood brothers, and the Wigrams, rebuilt the 
		tradition. In the later twenties, the dynamic and charming personality 
		of van Noorden, of Clare, with his friend Wyn Harris, the Everest climber 
		and Kenya commissioner, presided over a period of brilliant development; 
		which, later, gave to Cambridge a representation in the exploring and 
		Himalayan fields as worthy as in the opening up of the Alps by the pioneering 
		generation. To this period belongs Gino Watkins, the greatest of all undergraduate 
		explorers, not only for his outstanding achievements, but also for his 
		contributions to the progress of exploration as a whole. He demonstrated 
		the art of leadership brought to a far higher pitch than had ever been 
		attained by the &quot;semi-military&quot; organisation of previous expeditions; 
		and the supreme art of living off a country, even through the Arctic winter, 
		in the same manner as its native inhabitants. Thus he was probably the 
		first Englishman to learn how to handle a kayak, and he successfully undertook 
		sledge journeys of unprecedented length. Besides exploration and mountaineering, 
		he was greatly interested in the development of flying, and one of his 
		expeditions was made with the object of surveying a projected Arctic air 
		route. He led his first expedition at the age of nineteen, and his last 
		at the age of twenty-two, while still an undergraduate. To this period 
		also belong the explorers and mountaineers Longland, Peter Lloyd, the 
		Wagers; the Bicknells, Spencer Chapman, the Wakefields, Ted Hicks, Tony 
		Dummett, Robert Chew, the Trevelyan cousins; and Eric Shipton only missed 
		being with them because of a misunderstanding with a master of a College 
		about the uses of Geology. The Winthrop Young house in Bene’t Place was 
		the rallying point for the generation. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		club meet, apart from any there may have been before the war, took place 
		at Ogwen, in the Easter vacation of r gag. Half the party stayed at Ogwen 
		Cottage, and half camped nearby. The weather was bad, but nevertheless 
		a good deal of climbing was done, mostly on Tryfan, and everyone in the 
		party went round the Snowdon horseshoe. Several members of the party were 
		complete beginners, and the first day was devoted entirely to the Milestone 
		Buttress, for their benefit. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		C.U.M.C. meet in the Alps was held in the summer of the same year, at 
		Les Evettes, under the leadership of Mr. L. A. Ellwood, then president 
		of the club, and it appears that it was entirely owing to his initiative 
		and enthusiasm that the meet was held. It is evident from the earlier 
		numbers of &quot; Oxford and Cambridge Mountaineering&quot; that members 
		of the club had been climbing in the Alps during previous seasons, but 
		the meet gave this opportunity to many who could not otherwise possibly 
		have afforded it. Mr. Ellwood took infinite pains over the organisation 
		of every detail of the journey, and finally provided a month’s mountaineering 
		in the Alps at a total cost, including fares, of under £20 a head. As 
		a fitting reward for his labours, the meet was blessed with perfect weather, 
		there being only two wet days in the whole month. As the figure just cited 
		will suggest, no guides were employed; and the precedent of guideless 
		climbing thus set up has been followed more or less faithfully at club 
		meets ever since. Since 1911 the Charles Donald Robertson Fund, established 
		in memory of a notable mountaineer and fellow of Trinity, who was killed 
		on Glyder Fach, has assisted towards the expenses of mountain holidays: 
		special grants, from associated funds in memory of Charles Edward Matthews 
		and George Leigh-Mallory, being allocated to climbing. </P>
	  <P>A new departure 
		in the summer of 1932 was a meet in Norway; the reason given for the idea 
		in the official account of the meet being that at that time the pound 
		was worth only fifteen shillings, in Switzerland, but twenty-two shillings 
		in Norway. Elsewhere in the same account it is mentioned that six of the 
		party of ten were Scotsmen. The meet was highly successful, and among 
		other things the catering arrangements at Norwegian hotels came in for 
		much praise. At Easter, the following year, there was .html new venture, 
		in the shape of a ski-mountaineering meet in the Bernese Oberland, also 
		a great success. The weather was good, but conditions were not perfect 
		in that snow was scarce that year, which increased the difficulty of the 
		glaciers and left the tops icy. True to the best traditions, the party 
		was guideless. As it was nine in number, and most of its members had had 
		a fair amount of experience of skiing, this did not provide a source of 
		anxiety. It is greatly to be hoped that when such things are again possible, 
		there will be more meets on these ambitious and out-of-the-ordinary lines. 
		There is now less danger than there was in the thirties of skiing and 
		mountaineering being regarded as distinct interests, and of the skiers 
		as such swamping the mountaineering element. Skiing has now become a recognised 
		branch of greater mountaineering. </P>
	  <P>And so we 
		come to the present day. The writing of its history must be left to later 
		authors; suffice to say that of the time of the second world war, unlike 
		that of the first, there will be some history to write; indeed, far from 
		flickering out, as in 1914, and in spite of the short time in which present-day 
		members can gather experience before they must leave the club, the C.U.M.C. 
		to-day is as active and enthusiastic as ever. As it is hoped that this 
		journal will show. </P>
