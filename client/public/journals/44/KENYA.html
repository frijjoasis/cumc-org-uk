		<H1>Mount Kenya</H1><HR>
		<H2>R. M. L. Westropp</H2>
		<H3>Westcott House</H3>
	  
	  <P>HIS majestic 
		mountain stands quite alone, almost dead on the equator, rising from the 
		Kenya highlands to a height of 17,040 feet. It consists to-day of a forest 
		belt, an alpine zone, glaciers and the central peak. I am indebted to 
		Professor J. W. Gregory�s article in Major E. A. T. Dutton�s excellent 
		book, &quot;Kenya Mountain &quot;, for the following facts concerning 
		the mountain�s geology. The mountain is the ruined stump of: an ancient 
		volcano which, when in eruption, was many thousands of feet higher than 
		at present. The centre peak which is the dominating feature of the mountain 
		consists of rock which solidified in the throat of the volcano when the 
		volcanic forces waned; it consolidated as a plug of hard rock which sealed 
		up the outlet like a cork in a bottle. This plug has now been left as 
		the summit of the mountain, owing to the wearing away of the softer volcanic 
		tuffs which formed the walls of the crater and of the pipe. The mountain 
		is therefore a volcano in an advanced state of decay, and is extremely 
		old, the crater having been both formed and destroyed before the final 
		upheaval of the Alps. </P>

		Main Peak (N.E.) and head of Hinde Valley</DIV>
	  <P>When Professor 
		Gregory visited the mountain in 1893, the rock of which it is composed 
		had not been found elsewhere and so he called it Kenyte. This rock is 
		a lava containing more alkali that most igneous rocks and much of the 
		mineral olivine. It has since been discovered in Antarctica. </P>
	  <P>Though Ptolemy 
		is supposed to have included Mount Kenya in his snow-clad mountains which 
		form the source of the White Nile, we must give the credit for its discovery 
		in modern times to a German missionary, Dr. Lewis Krapf. On December 3rd, 
		1849, Dr. Krapf was taken by some natives to a vantage point some ninety 
		miles away, whence he saw Kenya for the first time. He records that: &quot; 
		It appeared to be like a gigantic wall on whose summit I observed two 
		immense towers, or horns as you may call them. These horns or towers, 
		which are at a short distance from each other, give the mountain a grand 
		and majestic appearance, which raised in my mind overwhelming feelings.&quot; 
		</P>
	  <P>This majestic 
		goddess reared her head for some fifty years more unapproached by man, 
		until in 1899, on September 13th, Sir Halford MacKinder and his two Swiss 
		guides reached the summit. MacKinder�s whole party consisted of himself, 
		his partner in the expedition, two Swiss guides from Courmayeur and two 
		collectors. At Zanzibar he enlisted 59 native porters, and at Nairobi 
		a further 98 natives. After many vicissitudes of travel they reached the 
		glaciers and pitched their camp, and, on the third attempt, the mountain 
		yielded. On this and on the first attempt the party spent a night on the 
		exposed and icy slabs. The final attempt was made up the South-east face 
		on to the South Ar0te, but then instead of going up on to Nelion the party 
		made a most difficult traverse and cut steps up the Darwin glacier and 
		then up the most difficult obstacle of all, the Diamond glacier. As this 
		was only a hundred feet wide, they calculated that it would take them 
		twenty minutes: while in point of fact it took them three hours, but they 
		were rewarded by reaching the summit of Batian, which proved to be the 
		highest peak. </P>
	  <P>Thirty years 
		elapsed before the second ascent was made, by three expert mountaineers, 
		E. E. Shipton, P. Wyn Harris and G. A. Sommerfelt. Shipton and Wyn Harris 
		reached the summit on January 15th, 1929. They at first attempted the 
		North face, but 400 feet from the summit they came up against &quot;a 
		smooth wall, quite vertical and in places overhanging &quot;, which they 
		could not pass. &quot; The rock scenery was some of the finest I have 
		ever seen &quot;, writes Shipton. However, the South- east face yielded, 
		and Shipton modestly describes the most difficult pitch as &quot;a traverse 
		along an exposed ledge and up a rickety crack � a run-out of 60 feet &quot;. 
		Of the peak itself he says: &quot;The climbing on the peak compares favourably 
		with any of the greater peaks in the Alps. The difficulty of the climbing 
		on our route is similar to that of the Meije in the Dauphin&eacute;, though 
		it is rather shorter. I have never seen on any mountain, with the exception 
		perhaps of Mont Blanc, such a variety of ridges and faces as on the peaks 
		of Mount Kenya &quot;. </P>
	  <P>Up to 1942 
		only some six parties, including one woman, had reached the summit; but 
		the war brought many mountaineers to East Africa who made the most of 
		their opportunities. Ten days leave enabled the writer to join with four 
		others in an attempt on the summit, and although this was not achieved 
		by some 300 feet, it was an unforgettable experience, The party consisted 
		of Oswald Wigram, as leader, Daphne Wingfield-Digby, Gordon Harvey, Charles 
		Haddow, the writer and fifteen porters. </P>
	  <P>A three-quarter 
		ton truck transported us and the rations for ourselves and the porters 
		the 130 miles odd from Nairobi to Trinau, where we made our base at the 
		farm of hospitable Mr. and Mrs. W. Powys. Two stops were made on the way, 
		one to buy rations and blankets for the porters, a lengthy process as 
		they did the shopping themselves, and the other to take a cup of tea and 
		final advice about the mountain from P. Wyn Harris, now a district Commissioner 
		at Nyevi. </P>
	  <P>The party 
		finally set off at 11.30 on Saturday, February 7th. Fifteen porters may 
		seem a large number for five climbers, but they had to carry all the equipment, 
		tents, sleeping bags, cooking utensils and food for eight days, By no 
		means the lightest portion of their load was their own food. On such an 
		expedition it is always a fine point to decide the number of porters to 
		carry the necessary impedimenta, and the further number required to carry 
		food for the first lot, and so on. Their normal food is posho, a meal 
		made from the mealie, but meat is dear to their heart and the proudest 
		member of their party was one who carried the dissected carcase of a sheep, 
		the generous gift of Mr. Powys. His load grew quickly lighter, but nevertheless 
		on the second and third days in the hot sun it was advisable to keep upwind 
		of him. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		day�s going was very pleasant, over moorland in bright sunshine, starting 
		about 9,000 feet up. Camp was pitched at about 5 p.m. at the Marania river. 
		Throughout the day we were regaled by magnificent views of the distant 
		peak, on which there appeared to have been a heavy snowfall. By approaching 
		from the North-west we avoided the forest belt which almost encircles 
		the mountain. On Sunday the moorland gradually gave way to tussocky grass 
		which made extremely hard going. The weather was perfect and the distant 
		views magnificent. It was difficult to imagine that the snow-clad peak 
		ahead of us rose to 17,000 feet. At lunchtime we were able to have a bathe 
		in an ice-cold river, soon compensated for by the warm sun. Camp was pitched 
		that night by the Gathita river, at about 12,000 feet. Gone were the warm 
		nights, and we awoke to find all that had been running water frozen solid. 
		At this altitude it regularly freezes solid at night and thaws completely 
		in the daytime. The porters, who had come from a hundred miles away, were 
		thrilled, and were very keen to take some ice home to their friends! </P>
	  <P>Early next 
		morning we climbed the ridge which looks down into the Hinde valley, which 
		runs north-east from the main peak. We had a grand view of Point Lenana 
		(16,300 feet), Point Thomson and the main peak itself, scarcely showing 
		its twin peaks at this angle. It seemed to tower above us, and to have 
		come suddenly within our reach overnight. Giant Groundsel, (<I>Senecio 
		Kenyense</I>), and Giant Lobelias, (<I>Lobelia Telekii</I>), were the 
		only vegetation in the valley below, and on a shelf at about 14,800 feet 
		vegetation ceased altogether. Here we pitched our most advanced camp, 
		as there was water and fuel available. A snowfall in the afternoon had 
		made our porters pitch a tent and light a fire, and we had to go back 
		a long way to fetch them. Fortunately sunshine followed, or else we might 
		never have got them to move. As soon as we had pitched camp it came on 
		to snow heavily. Two brave members of the party went outside to dig a 
		trench round the hut. Daphne worked wonders with the primus inside our 
		tent, and produced hot cocoa from the midst of a pile of rucksacks and 
		boots, while outside, Charles defied snowBakes and sopping wood and managed 
		to warm a good brew of M. &amp;. V. The thermometer registered 22� of 
		frost that night. </P>
	  <P>Tuesday 
		was declared a Sunday or day of rest. After prayers taken by Oswald four 
		of us set out to explore. Gordon had been nursing �flu all the time and 
		so stayed in camp. We ended by climbing Point Lenana (16,300 ft.), a straightforward 
		climb over snow on to the summit. On the way down we encountered an electric 
		storm which charged our ice-axes, and sent a stream of sparks across the 
		gap between a metal band in my helmet and my head. Rather a pleasant sensation.

	  On Wednesday 
	  we moved to the club hut on the Lewis glacier at 16,000 ft. The porters 
	  carried our food, bedding and fuel, and went back to sleep at the camp in 
	  the Hinde valley. Another party under the leadership of Alan Ker was already 
	  in occupation of the hut, so three of us slept in a tent. The move involved 
	  hard going over bad scree. We said goodbye to vegetation and the grim though 
	  majestic North face, which had defeated. Shipton and his party, to exchange 
	  then for real Alpine conditions � a glacier on our doorstep and the superb 
	  South-east face of the peak towering invitingly for a thousand feet sheer 
	  above the glacier. This was our goal for the morrow. The afternoon was spent 
	  in exploring the glacier and surrounding eminences, and gasping at the view. 
	  Such scenery entirely new to me and to some of the others.  
	  
	  <P>By 7.15 
		the next morning, just as it got light, Alan Ker, Oswald Wigram, a native 
		called Mutu Muthara and myself crossed the glacier to the� foot of the 
		peak, and started our climb. Climbing on two ropes, we made steady progress, 
		giving ourselves time to look at the scenery. At one point the snow-clad 
		dome of Kilimanjaro (19,455 ft.), 200 miles away to the South, stood out 
		glistening pinkish in the early morning sun, above a white sea of cloud: 
		truly the heavens declared to us the glory of God in his handywork. As 
		far as we could we followed Shipton�s route. The climbing was most interesting 
		the whole way, especially the boulder in the chimney. The ar&ecirc;te 
		was reached at 10.30, giving us a grand view into the &quot; works &quot;, 
		where the Diamond and Darwin glaciers flow out to the South-west from 
		the Gate of the Mists between the two peaks Batian (17,400 ft.) and Nelion 
		(17,000 ft.). By 11.30 we reached the gendarme. The clouds were breaking 
		up and gathering round us, swirling round Point St. John and Budget Peak 
		below us, making them appear like phantom peaks. Above the gendarme, only 
		three or four hundred feet from the summit,. we came to Shipton�s &quot;rickety 
		crack&quot;. It�s exposed position, the delay it caused us, the threatening 
		weather, and the fact that two of us were married, made us dcecide to 
		turn back. We turned at 11.45 p.m. As it happened, only a little snow 
		fell, and we had an excellent descent. We appreciated a hot meal on our 
		return, as we had only had porridge and coffee for breakfast, and oranges, 
		chocolate and barley sugar while climbing. </P>
	  <P>The next 
		day, Friday, the porters came and fetched our stuff, and four of us decided 
		to return to our camp in the Hinde valley by continuing round the peak 
		in a clockwise direction. This involved considerable up and down scrambling. 
		In the morning we got grand views of Point St. John, the Darwin and Diamond 
		glaciers, Nelion and Batian, and Point Piggott. At mid-day clouds and 
		bitterly cold rain descended upon us, and we had to depend upon compass 
		bearings. Late afternoon brought clear weather again and we found ourselves 
		where we wanted to be, approaching the saddle at the head of the Gorges 
		and MacKinder valleys, and were soon over the ridge into the Hinde valley 
		where our camp was. </P>
	  <P>The next 
		day we packed up and made the journey back to the farm, the chief excitement 
		being the sight of a rhino at close quarters. Fortunately when he was 
		disturbed he went off in the opposite direction. Despite the use of sunburn 
		cream some faces and arms got well burnt, but Gordon�s �flu was quite 
		cured, as was also a nasty boil on Oswald�s leg, and only one member of 
		the party suffered from bad headaches at the higher altitudes. The climbing 
		party were unaffected by the altitude. </P>
	  <P>Should anyone 
		find themselves within reach of this magnificent mountain and require 
		information about climbing, a note to the Secretary of the Mountain Club 
		of East Africa. P.O. Box 281, Nairobi, will bring prompt and willing assistance. 
		We are much indebted to the Secretary for his courtesy and information. 
		</P>
