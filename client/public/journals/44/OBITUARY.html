		<H1>Obituary</H1><HR>
		<H2>Flying Officer D. F. H. Biggane, D.F.C., R.A.F.V.R.</H2>
		<H3>Killed in action over Germany, December, 1942</H3>
	  
	  <P>IT is far 
		from easy to pay an adequate tribute to the memory of Denny Biggane in 
		a short space. He was a most interesting, rather complex, and lovable 
		character, and to enlarge upon his many fine points would take up more 
		space than I may claim. Of one thing let us be clear at the outset: the 
		1941 Climbers’ Club Journal says that: &quot;In the spring of this year 
		there was a great renaissance in Welsh climbing, chiefly caused by the 
		activities of the C.U.M.C.&quot; Denny was one of the people most concerned 
		with that renaissance. </P>
	  <P>He was a 
		true man of the rocks, for they, and the Welsh rocks especially, were 
		his happy hunting ground. He was a great stylist, and to watch him moving 
		gracefully, carefully and with the minimum of effort up such a slab as 
		that of Mickledore Grooves was an experience never to be forgotten. The 
		&quot;wide open faces &quot; were his delight, and upon them his technique 
		of delicacy and nicety of balance came into its own and he excelled. In 
		chimneys and cracks he was never so comfortable. He did not enjoy to the 
		same extent, the cruder methods for which they called, but in such places 
		he could always be relied upon for a humorous time. </P>
	  <P>He was indeed 
		a curious mixture of efficiency on the rocks and haphazard lack of concern 
		about his equipment. He would walk from Langdale to Scafell in his Sunday 
		shoes; he seldom carried a rope, and when he did, he did not expect other 
		people to trust it, so we took our own. He would do similar odd things 
		in everyday life at Cambridge, and his eccentric ways led to the weaving 
		of numerous comic tales about him, which only served to amuse him, and 
		to make everyone like him the more. On one occasion he set off from Helyg 
		to climb a route on Dinas Mot, for which crag, remote as it is from Helyg, 
		he had such an affection that it became known as &quot;Denny’s Mot &quot;. 
		He took with him an old envelope, on which he had scribbled what he could 
		learn about the route, and an ancient, rusty and bent piton from the tool 
		drawer in the hut, &quot;just in case &quot;. At the top of the first 
		pitch the envelope blew away. A little later, the stone which had served 
		as a piton hammer split in half and nearly dislodged the second man. Despite 
		these mishaps they accomplished the climb successfully, but with some 
		doubt as to the route taken. At first, such tales of apparent incompetence 
		led to distrust and doubt, but one had only to climb with him to know 
		that he was a first-rate leader upon whom one could always rely in any 
		difficult situation. </P>
	  <P>His quiet 
		and modest, but deep, courage was well displayed on those days when he 
		could not find a companion. Then he would climb alone, and he amazed many 
		of us by ascending in this way such climbs as the Munich climb on Tryfan, 
		Asterisk on Gimmer Crag and the South-west on Pillar Rock, and by making 
		serious attempts on such places as Grooved Wall on Pillar Rock and Lot’s 
		Wife on Glyder Fach. </P>
	  <P>From Cambridge 
		he went to the R.A.F., and his colleagues in Bomber Command evidently 
		appreciated him as much as we did. He became very fond of flying, perhaps 
		on account of its affinities with climbing, and his deeds in the air made 
		some excellent stories. I remember well the great joy with which he told 
		me of flying over the Alps to Italy in bright moonlight. His own supreme 
		modesty and capacity for understatement left me to guess at the part which 
		he himself had played in these operations, but his navigator, now a prisoner 
		of war, has written to say that Denny was the bravest man he ever knew; 
		and if we had thought, we might have known that he would be. </P>
	  <P>We have 
		lost an incomparable climbing companion and a great friend. All who knew 
		him in the C.U.M.C. will agree to this, and will join in an expression 
		of sympathy with those who knew him better than we did, and have so lost 
		more. This stanza by Geoffrey Winthrop Young, which was a favourite of 
		Denny’s, seems an appropriate conclusion: </P>
	  <DIR> 
		<DIR> 
		  <P>I have 
			not lost the magic of long days; <BR>
			I live them, dream them still. <BR>
			Still am I master of the starry ways, <BR>
			And freeman of the hill. <BR>
			Shattered my glass, ere half the sands had run – <BR>
			I hold the heights, I hold the heights I won. </P>
		</DIR>
	  </DIR>
	  <P>C.F.R.</P>
