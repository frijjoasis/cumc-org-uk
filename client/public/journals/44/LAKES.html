	<H1>Mainly on the Lake District</H1><HR>
		<H2>R. W. CAHN</H2>
		<H3>Trinity</H3>
	  
	  <P>IT began 
		early. Ever since leaving Germany as a small boy, a fugutive from the 
		F&uuml;hrer, I have been surrounded by all sorts of mountains; that is 
		probably the only thing I have to thank the F&uuml;hrer for. The first 
		were the cliff�s and hills of Majorca, an island where the most varied 
		beauties of hill, plain and shore are compressed into the space of a few 
		square miles. When we had been set free from the schoolroom some hot summer 
		afternoon, a pack of us, wearing only shorts and a pair of alpargatas 
		� light canvas shoes with rope soles which every- one in these parts wears 
		� would rush out over the parched heath towards the fresh air of the seashore 
		and the cliffs. And what adventures we had among them, those fantastic 
		limestone shapes, their features wrinkled by wind and sea into countless 
		corrugations which the alpargatas gripped with delightful firmness; with 
		their great mysterious caves, in which the breakers boomed resonantly 
		over stolid ranks of sea-hedgehogs and other queer-shaped creatures. This 
		was the training ground where I first learnt to climb with all four extremities, 
		There was one particularly large cave, with a chimney at the far end; 
		you climbed up this, and suddenly you� emerged from the cold clammy recess 
		on to a sun-baked plateau high above the sea. It was a new surprise every 
		time we did it, and rather what I imagine the &quot;secret&quot; chimney 
		on the Bhasteir tooth to be like. But the Spanish sun in summer has little 
		in common with its feeble counterpart of more northerly latitudes, and 
		soon we would be scampering off again to the shelter of our caves. </P>
	  <P>Once I was 
		taken for a holiday to Valldemosa, a little village tucked away among 
		the central hills - the place where Chopin spent leisured years composing 
		his most entrancing melodies. They were parched, sparsely vegetated hills, 
		crouching low as if ducking from the stinging rays of the sun. The name 
		Georges Sand gave to the island, &quot;La verde Helvecia&quot;, the green 
		Switzerland, must be taken as artistic license; those hills were .more 
		the sort of thing, I fancy, that the Author of &quot;Don .Quixote&quot; 
		had in mind when he described that wretched knight�s wanderings through 
		the wastes of the Sierra Morena. The cool vineyards and gardens of the 
		village were definitely more inviting. </P>
	  <P>Another 
		place that deserves mention is the great mountain under whose shadow I 
		lived for a while, Mont Serrat, in Catalonia, a great jagged rock peak 
		rising abruptly from the foothills of the Pyrenees. It gives pretty good 
		climbing, and its rock towers are popular with Spanish mountaineers. Perched 
		somewhere near the summit is a monastery, famous all over Spain. </P>
	  <P>The Civil 
		War turned everybody�s thoughts to anything but mountains, but as fate 
		would have it I found myself not long after its outbreak among the Dolomites 
		of Southern Tyrol. It is hardly necessary to say that they were a revelation. 
		Their gigantic size and appalling steepness, and especially the absolute 
		bareness of their gleaming white rock, overpowered the mind, but yet at 
		the same time held out a promise of joys to come. They became to me what 
		the engine-driver�s cabin and the pirate�s quarterdeck are to other boys 
		of the same age, and I can remember with what mixed jealousy and admiration 
		I saw bronzed and tough-looking Italian youths setting out for the mountains 
		with axe and rope. That was one of the few good things the Duce introduced, 
		the training of young people among great peaks, and we might with advantage 
		imitate it, as Geoffrey Winthrop Young has suggested. The most impressive 
		of all those magnificent mountains was the Langkofel, a lengthy ridge 
		buttressed by huge towers, and a true climbers� paradise, as readers of 
		Smythe�s &quot;Adventures of a. Mountaineer&quot; will know. </P>
	  <P>But it was 
		left to that perfect miniature of mountain landscape, the English Lake 
		District, to turn admiration into action. In 1940, hustled out of London 
		by anxious parents, I woke up one morning after a night journey by road 
		from Windermere to find Buttermere Moss looking down at me through the 
		window. A modest sort of mountain, you may say, but to one who had barely 
		seen a molehill for years it was lofty enough. Well, there I was, an hour 
		later, puffing and blowing up my first real hill. Standing at last upon 
		the summit, out of breath and up to my ankles in one of those ubiquitous 
		Lakeland bogs, I felt at last the true joy of the mountaineer, and made 
		a firm resolve that before .html year had. passed I would set foot on 
		all the dozens of peaks that were visible even from that low eminence. 
		It wasn�t allowing a great deal of time, but two years later the ambition 
		had been fulfilled and surpassed. There was the mighty Grassmoor, (the 
		Lake District has of course a scale of adjectives all its own), with its 
		halo of lesser heights, Hobcarton, Sail, Causey Pike; the ridge of High 
		Stile, above Buttermere, with its grand view and succulent bilberries; 
		massive Pillar Mountain and the slender Steeple, rising from the deserted 
		valley of Ennerdale. Then again, a kindly walker took me up the Guide�s 
		route to Scafell Pikes, the highest of them all; this is a fine mountaineering 
		route, winding its way up the mountain�s flank to land one on the boulder-strewn 
		summit plateau. One would have thought that a debris-covered, windswept 
		summit like the Pikes would be even less inviting than the hills of Majorca; 
		yet it is a remarkable fact that the bare stark nature of many of the 
		Lake District hilltops lends them a peculiar attractiveness. Perhaps it 
		is due to the part they play in furnishing .html contrast in a land 
		already rich in contrasts: steep rock face against gentle grass slope; 
		dry bracken, russet heather and grass against blue lakes and grey rocks; 
		and the most obvious contrast of all, the ceaseless changing of the weather. 
		Then there was the true sovereign of the Lakes, Great Gable, a mountain 
		of many aspects, but majestic in them all, and possessing one of the best 
		views in all the district; Skiddaw, the shapeless mass that looks so imposing 
		and is so impossibly tame, with its complete lack of contrast and its 
		path fit for a four-in-hand right up to the summit; Catbells and Maiden 
		Moor, odd-shaped sentinels of Derwentwater.... there seemed to be no end 
		to the summits we could tread. </P>

		   New West Climb, Pillar Rock</DIV> 
		
	  
	 <P> And then, just 
	  when I was beginning to feel myself the &quot;Compleat Mountaineer &quot;, 
	  vast new fields were suddenly opened up by the possibility of climbing. 
	  I had always thought of rock-climbers as very superior persons who were 
	  on .html plane altogether from us humble walkers, until one day I found 
	  myself gaily scaling the vertical side of Pillar Rock with a sangfroid I 
	  should have shuddered at a year before. This New West climb really does 
	  merit the attention of all climbers, from the trembling novice to the most 
	  hardened veteran bred in the tradition of de Selincourtian gravity-defiance. 
	  It has plenty of exposure and sensational positions, it is steep in the 
	  most modern meaning of the word, and in its three hundred feet or so of 
	  continuous climbing it calls for all types of technique. It starts with 
	  a &quot;staircase &quot;, traverses off the &quot;landing&quot; to a steep 
	  groove, soon after which the climber can spreadeagle himself on a step even 
	  wider than the notorious Strid on the North climb. Then follows a beautiful 
	  chimney, complete with chockstone, and topped by a wicked vice which most 
	  people attempt the first time they do the climb, in the mistaken belief 
	  that the route continues up it. As a matter of fact, it emerges from the 
	  chimney to follow a traverse which is almost completely hidden from the 
	  climber inside the chimney. This traverse is not lavish with its handholds, 
	  and gives exhilarating balance climbing. Finally there is a dose of good 
	  smooth slabs, which take one right out on to the summit of the Rock. The 
	  sort of perfect climb that a valley-bound cragsman might compose for the 
	  so1ace of his imagination, as a gourmet on a desert island might conjure 
	  up visions of the perfect meal. And yet withal it is easy enough, unless 
	  of course it happens to be raining.</P>  
	  
	  <P>There are 
		plenty of other climbs of moderate difficulty on the Rock; the North climb 
		is of course one of the classic climbs of Great Britain. There� is one 
		place on it where the leader unropes and makes a long detour to avoid 
		the only tough place on the climb, which incidentally makes up for all 
		the other tough places that aren�t. When I did this I spent a considerable 
		time trying to locate my second when I had reached the top; while his 
		mind was no doubt filled with the most gloomy forebodings. </P>
	  <P>The Pillar 
		Rock is impressive enough, especially if you approach Low Man in mist, 
		(the normal state), when the great steep ribs soar up into what seems 
		to be infinity. But, even on a fine day, I know of nothing to compete 
		with the face of Scafell for sheer splendour and power of rock scenery. 
		One gets a good view of the whole thing from Pikes Crag, but I found it 
		most awe-inspiring to scramble up the bed of Deep Ghyll, an enormously 
		deep ravine cutting back between the sheer walls of Deep Ghyll Buttress 
		and the Pinnacle. On either side you have the walls of the ravine, and 
		between them a narrow field of view filled by Great Gable and Pillar. 
		We tried one of the climbs on the Pinnacle Wall of the ghyll, known as 
		Jones and Collier�s climb, which was first climbed by the great pioneer 
		Own Glynne Jones. It consists mainly of a continuous traverse above an 
		overhang, with the bed of the ghyll dropping away below. We did it in 
		boots, and as a result I would recommend rubbers for this climb; the holds 
		are strictly of utility quality. One finishes to the top along the famous 
		Knife-edge Ar0te, which is ascended horseback-fashion on account of the 
		considerable drop below on either side. The Pinnacle has a number of things 
		in common with the Pillar Rock, including a gap which prevents direct 
		access to the summit. Below Low Man, falling sheer, is the Pinnacle Face. 
		The routes up this face are climbs of the highest delicacy, with few belays 
		worthy of the name �.the sort of place where the rule that the leader 
		must not fall is expanded to include every member of the party. The face 
		has a number of casualties to its discredit, and we left it well alone, 
		until such time as we might become very much more competent climbers. 
		We sampled thc buttress climbing on Scafell by going up the Keswick Brothers� 
		climb, an old favourite, which works its way pleasantly up one of the 
		steeply tilted strata which compose the left-hand part of Scafell Precipice. 
		It is a true face climb, though it does sometimes delve into a chimney 
		where a flake has split away from the main stratum. </P>
	  <P>While it 
		is true that a large proportion of the best climbing is in the central 
		massif around Great Gable, that versatile mountain which attracts the 
		climber as much as the walker, there is a great deal scattered more diffusely 
		over the rest of the district. Gimmer Crag, for instance, proved to be 
		an ideal place to spend a hot unenergetic summer�s day. Most of the climbs 
		are hard, some of them very, but they are short, and the crag has the 
		advantage of being easily reached; the climbs perhaps tend to be what 
		is called rock gymnastics, but they provide at least excellent training. 
		Langdale is dotted about with other climbs, for instance the classic Bowfell 
		Buttress, surely one of the most enjoyable of its kind, continuous and 
		not artificial. Dow Crag would almost constitute a life-study in itself, 
		with its small area with an incredible concentration of routes of all 
		types and standards. In the latter respect it differs from Lliwedd, which 
		is more uniformly hard, I should just like to mention Gordon and Craig�s 
		route, which we found remarkable for a long dead level traverse with so 
		little lebensraum that it is necessary almost to bend double and lean 
		out over space � a good test of balance. </P>
	  <P>Finally, 
		there are any number of &quot;outlying crags &quot;, as the guide-books 
		call them, the Mecca of those with a bent for blazing new trails. Thus 
		the Buttermere region, and especially Birkness Coombe, above Buttermere 
		Lake, has been extensively developed in recent years, as a glance at recent 
		numbers of the Journal of the Fell and Rock Climbing Club will show. We 
		couldn�t resist the temptation to try and make a variation to the &quot;Oxford 
		and Cambridge&quot; Climb, in this coombe, just to shift the balance in 
		favour of Cambridge; our success was highly questionable, as the said 
		variation was partly done on a rope. However, it consists of swarming 
		up a sort of pinnacle and then traversing horizontally across Dexter Wall 
		to join the parent climb at the top of the second pitch, and is quite 
		entertaining. This sort of thing is very small meat, but A. T. Hargreaves, 
		who ought to know, assures us in an article in the above-mentioned journal 
		that there are still various crags awaiting such intensive exploration 
		as Buttermere has had. </P>
	  <P>During the 
		war we have been restricted to the hills of Britain, though I imagine 
		that most of us are not conscious of this as a restriction at all. We 
		have learnt to cherish these hills for their own sake, and not to value 
		them merely as a training ground for attempts on bigger game. The Lake 
		District is far more than this; and have not Alpine and Himalayan climbers 
		who spent early years on its crags always returned to its friendly intimacy 
		after months spent on inhospitable snow and ice? Certainly, should it 
		ever be my fortune to climb on bigger mountains, I shall nevertheless 
		come back to the cradle of my mountaineering aspirations, the English 
		Lakes. </P>
