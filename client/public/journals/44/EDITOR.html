		<H1>Editorial</H1><HR>
	  
	  <P>IT is with 
		considerable diffidence that we put before the mountaineering world .html 
		number of &quot;Cambridge Mountaineering &quot;. This is not solely on 
		account of modesty, false or otherwise, with regard to its value as an 
		addition to the already considerable bulk of the world’s printed literature; 
		nor is it because we feel ill-equipped to meet those critics who have 
		doubts as to whether there has been any Cambridge mountaineering worth 
		writing about since our last number came out. The question is: is anyone 
		outside the club going to find it worth reading about? </P>
	  <P>We cannot 
		present the Journal as a sort of report of progress, a thrilling account 
		of the last few years’ bag of new &quot;very severes &quot;, served up 
		with a tasteful seasoning of articles. Indeed we have not even included 
		a section on new climbs, not, as a matter of fact, because there are none, 
		but because their originators have already described elsewhere such as 
		there are, or else, with an altruistic desire not to spoil the routes 
		for others, have refused to describe them at all. Instead, we present 
		an article designed primarily for home consumption. It has been the tradition 
		in the past that the Journal should be designed in the first place to 
		interest those who write in it, and their friends; and after that we have 
		hoped it might interest mountaineers outside the club, without being greatly 
		put out if it did not. To this tradition it has been our intention to 
		adhere. Further, as . the club exists largely for the encouragement and 
		instruction of beginners in climbing, we hope that the Journal will play 
		its part here also. If it will serve to assist and encourage those novices 
		who form the overwhelming majority in the club at present, it will have 
		justified itself. If it interests anyone outside the club to know what 
		we have been doing recently, and what some of us feel about what we have 
		done, we shall be greatly encouraged. </P>
	  <P>Our acknowledgments 
		should be as many as the difficulties we have been enabled to overcome, 
		but that would make this editorial, far too long already, altogether exceed 
		the space allotted to it. First and foremost, of course, we are indebted 
		to all our contributors, to an obvious extent; but we should add an additional 
		note of thanks to those whose articles have had, either on account of 
		overlapping of subject-matter, or of shortage of space, to be omitted. 
		We are nevertheless grateful to them for their efforts, and gratified 
		at the evidence of keenness in the club which is afforded by the number 
		of articles the editor’s impassioned appeal produced. Then our thanks 
		are certainly due to our printers, both for their kindness in under- taking 
		to print a Journal at all under present circumstances, and for their patience 
		and co-operation at all times. We are indebted to the &quot;Alpine Journal 
		&quot; and to Mr. Sydney Spencer for the loan of a photograph. And, on 
		the executive side, we have to thank R. W. Cahn very warmly for his exceedingly 
		efficient and painstaking work as Journal Treasurer. </P>
	  <P>One request 
		we have to make. If anyone reading the article on the club history can 
		add anything to what is there recorded, we should be very glad to hear 
		from him. </P>
	  <P>In conclusion, 
		we must apologise profoundly for having been forced to raise the price 
		of the Journal: it has been increased in exactly the same proportion as 
		have the costs of production. </P>
