	  The Valley into Andorra </DIV>
		
	  <p>
	  HOW I came 
	  to visit Andorra is rather a casual story. My brother, two friends and myself 
	  decided that we wanted a change for our next holiday. Mountains, of course, 
	  but with a difference – no tourist crowds, no signposts, and the minimum 
	  of hotels. In fact, the simple life. Wandering where the spirit moved, and 
	  bivouacking wherever the spirit decided to hover for the night. We puffed 
	  our pipes, pulled thoughfully at our beer, and visualised tranquil evenings 
	  in the hills.... It is a remarkable thing that these tranquil visions always 
	  leave out cold, wet, bad nights when no-one sleeps a wink – and cooking 
	  and washing up above all. Thus are we led away from the flesh-pots into 
	  hypothetical bliss... It was at about this stage of our somewhat indefinite 
	  planning that someone suggested Andorra. Having located it on the map, and 
	  confirmed that it lay in the heart of the eastern Pyrenees, about midway 
	  between Toulouse and Barcelona, we listened with growing enthusiasm as the 
	  suggestion was elaborated. In brief, Andorra offered the following attractions: 
	  one hundred and ninety-one square miles of complicated gorges, valleys and 
	  defiles, surrounded by the high peaks of the Eastern Pyrenees; an altitude 
	  varying between 6,500 and 10,100 ft.; no railways, and only one road, running 
	  from the Spanish frontier at Arcabell in the South-west to the French frontier 
	  at L’Hospibalet in the North-east; a total population of five thousand, 
	  largely concentrated in the half-dozen or so villages, including the Capital, 
	  Andorra-la-Viella, which are scattered along the road; south of the road, 
	  which runs in the main river valley of the Gran Valira, practically uninhabitated 
	  country; above all, the road excepted, no ingress or egress except by more 
	  or less inaccessible mountain passes.</p>  
	  
	  <P>We were 
		convinced. Plans went ahead, and we left for France towards the end of 
		August, 1939. Travelling overnight, we reached Tarascon – not to be confused 
		with the other town of this name made famous by Alphonse Daudet’s "<I>Tartarin 
		de Tarascon</I>"– early on Sunday morning, and within an hour we were 
		getting off the bus at Auzat, a small village that stands guard over the 
		end of the valley we were to ascend for the next two days. Sunday does 
		not interfere with business in the French Provinces, so we were able to 
		equip ourselves with <I>espadrilles</I> – a kind of rope-soled sandal 
		– at a stall in the market place. They are ideal on the. hot, rocky tracks 
		of the region, but it takes time to get used to them, as they have no 
		heels, and have the further disadvantage of soaking up any available water 
		with a thirsty relish. </P>

		   The First Yasse </DIV>
		
	  
	  <P>After satisfying 
	  the curiosity of an elderly peasant woman as to our plans, and signally 
	  failing to convince her that we were not mad, we set off up the valley. 
	  Almost at its head, where the three frontiers meet, lay our first objective 
	  – a pass into Andorra known as the Port de Rat. It was very hot; our rucksacks 
	  seemed to grow more heavy as the day wore on, and we were almost glad when 
	  it began to cloud over. By mid-afternoon we were above the tree-line, and 
	  had to tackle our first <I>yasse</I>. A <I>yasse</I> is a peculiar bottleneck 
	  caused by the progressive narrowing of the valleys of this region, presenting 
	  the appearance of a rock wall, usually deeply cut by the river, which often 
	  descends in a series of fantastic rapids and water- falls. Once the <I>yasse</I> 
	  is surmounted the valley broadens, only to close in again a few miles further 
	  on, and one’s upward progress resembles the ascent of a gigantic flight 
	  of steps. By seven in the evening we were in a broad section of the valley 
	  with yet .html <I>yasse</I> about a mile ahead broken by the most picturesque 
	  gorge we had yet seen. We decided to camp for the night, and hoped that 
	  the weather might improve, as it had rained steadily for several hours. 
	  Food took some time to prepare, as the wet did not improve the combustibility 
	  of the prickly scented shrub which with the exception of grass was by now 

	  the only vegetation. It burned most reluctantly, and emitted a thick evil-smelling 
	  white smoke, despite encouragement provided by Meta tablets.</P>  
	  
	  <P>It was very 
		cold the next morning, and we could see little . beyond the <I>yasse</I>, 
		because of the mist which clung to the mountain sides. After a further 
		struggle with wet fuel we cooked breakfast and set about packing for the 
		day’s march. According to the map, it would be late afternoon before we 
		reached the tip of the valley, and as we should then be faced with a stiff 
		climb up the mountainside towards the Port de Rat, the continued bad weather 
		filled us with gloom. By the time we reached the <I>yasse</I> it was raining 
		steadily, and as we toiled up the rocky paths and ledges the sense of 
		desolation was increased by the hollow roar of the torrent below us, and 
		the eddies of mist which revealed ghostly shadows of the mountains towering 
		above. During the afternoon we came across an odd freak in a gloomy gully 
		– an isolated arch of snow spanning the stream, for all the world like 
		the crumbling ruin of an old abbey. It was the first snow we had seen, 
		a reminder that even at 6,000 ft. it can be cold where no sun penetrates. 
		</P>
	  <P>The main 
		stream was now quite a gently meandering ribbon, and we knew that there 
		was a lake not far ahead which marked the end of the valley and the beginning 
		of the climb up to the pass. By great good fortune the mist suddenly lifted 
		when the lake was but a stone’s throw away, and we took stock of our position.’ 
		The end of the valley was barred by a semicircle of mountains, and we 
		could see five torrents which cascaded down to the lake. Our way lay up 
		the mountainside to our left, and we decided to go on and try to reach 
		the pass in spite of the weather, rather than wait for an improvement 
		which seemed most unlikely. We established a compass bearing as a rough 
		guide, and set off as the mist damped down more 6rmly than ever. From 
		now on the map was useless, and none of us had much hope that we should 
		reach the pass’ by nightfall’ Visibility was restricted to a few yards 
		by mist and driving rain; the going was difficult, over loose rocks and 
		boulders, and became precipitous in places, and we were forced to make 
		infuriating detours to cross numerous swollen torrents. We plodded. on 
		mechanically under the burden of rucksacks which seemed to weigh a hundred 
		pounds, not thirty-five, and tried to find some consolation in the fact 
		that movement at least kept us warm. </P>
	  <P>Just before 
		sunset we decided it would be folly to go further, after three hours erratic 
		upward progress by compass bearing alone, and cast about for a spot sufficiently 
		level to pitch the tents, and sufficiently sheltered to prevent them blowing 
		away. </P>
	  <P>After some 
		searching, a tiny patch between two great boulders prescribed itself, 
		and we eventually succeeded in erecting both tents and crawling into them, 
		numb with cold, very wet, and nearly exhausted. However, once dry and 
		in our sleeping bags we felt better, and some food and a stiff tot of 
		brandy persuaded us that we might survive if the tents were not blown 
		away before morning! We slept fitfully, disturbed by the drumming of rain 
		on the tent when it was audible through the shriek of the wind, and by 
		the shriek of the wind when it was audible above the hollow rumbling of 
		the thunder- storm which wandered around all night without ever seeming 
		to settle directly overhead. For this concession we were duly thankful. 
		I have never seen such continuous lightning, and soon came to the conclusion 
		that a tent on the mountainside is not the best place from which. to view 
		a Pyrenean thunderstorm. </P>
	  <P>My brother 
		woke us the next morning with the welcome news that there was very little 
		mist and a magnificent view; he did not tell us how cold it was, but left 
		us to find out for ourselves. We were soon shivering beside him and taking 
		in the view. It was worth the discomfort. Far below we could see the lake, 
		fed by the silver threads to which the streams were reduced by the height 
		of our vantage point, and beyond the jagged snow- patched peaks, grey 
		and forbidding in the morning light, we could see the first peaks in Spain. 
		Beyond them, ridge on ridge, swept the serrated ranges of the Spanish 
		Pyrenees. Turning our bac4 on the entrancing panorama, we considered our 
		own problem. The broad gully in which our tents were pitched rose steeply 
		to a great ridge, of which we caught an occasional glimpse through the 
		mist which clung about it. Somewhere it was broken by the Port de Rat, 
		and we were all fervently hoping that we had not wandered too far off 
		the route in the previous day’s mist. A few minute’s work with map and 
		compass suggested that we were somewhere below the pass, so we ate a hasty 
		meal and struck camp, with no regrets at leaving so bleak a spot. </P>
	  <P>There appeared 
		to be a faint track running in a zig-zag up the gully, though it was so 
		faint at times that we were tempted to doubt its existence. However, when 
		the gully narrowed and its walls reached up vertically on either side, 
		the track became more definite, and often left the floor of the gully 
		for ledges running along the enclosing walls. We began to look above us 
		for the break that would indicate the Port de Rat and the frontier between 
		France and Andorra. At last we saw it, and put on a spurt, eager for our 
		first glimpse of the unknown. On reaching the pass we were not disappointed. 
		On either side of us the ridge rose steeply, and the pass itself was no 
		more than sixty feet wide. Behind lay the long. descent into France, and 
		before us, a great desolate valley, sweeping away to our left to be hidden 
		by the usual jagged peaks. This was our first view from a really good 
		vantage point, and we were greatly struck by the impression of mountain 
		ranges, and the absence of the dominating peaks which characterise Alpine 
		scenery. In this part of the Pyrenees, mountain ridges are the rule, isolated 
		peaks exceptional, and for this reason route-finding needs particular 
		care. Once in the wrong valley, where all valleys are so much alike, there 
		are no easily recognisable peaks to give warning of the error, and every 
		possibility of wasting a whole day in blissful ignorance of the fact that 
		the pass aimed at lies in the valley running parallel with, but inaccessible 
		from, the valley one is ascending. </P>
	  <P>To return 
		to the Port de Rat. Photographs taken, we donned our rucksacks, trudged 
		down a few hundred feet of dirty snow below the pass, and began the rough 
		descent to the valley. It soon began to rain again, but as our clothes 
		were still wet from the previous day we were indifferent, and comforted 
		ourselves with the knowledge that we should soon be in wooded country 
		and be able to light a fire. Already we could see clumps of stunted pines 
		on the slopes above, and we were thankful when we were in the thickly 
		wooded valley of the Riu de Tristany. All we had to do now was to follow 
		the stream, and it would lead us to Lo Serrat, the first Andorran village 
		for travellers entering by the Port de Rat. It was easier said than done. 
		We could certainly hear the stream, but it was usually several hundred 
		feet below us, and on the rare occasions when we established contact, 
		it perversely hurled itself down in water- falls or rapids, and disappeared 
		into yet .html gorge. .Infuriating detours had to be made in order to 
		cross tributary torrents, and a journey of half-a-dozen miles on the map 
		involved walking double the distance. An hour or two of erratic progress 
		down the valley of the Tristany reduced our conversation to the level 
		of muttered blasphemy, and when we saw Lo Serrat nearly a thousand feet 
		below us, and a mile or so away, our hearts sank. It was a mere huddle 
		of stone huts, and we recalled the warnings of friends about its poor 
		reputation for hospitality, However, we had to get there before we could 
		put its reputation to the test, and this was no mean problem. The going 
		got progressively worse with every yard we covered, and we plunged down 
		sodden grassy slopes, waded through streams, clambered over rocks and 
		forced our way through spiky undergrowth convinced that we were destined 
		never to find the track which ornamented the map. </P>
	  <P>When we 
		eventually stumbled on it, the village was only a few hundred yards away, 
		and it did little to relieve the general gloom into which we were plunged. 
		Land is precious in Andorra, and the few narrow stone houses were huddled 
		round the Church, and built two or three stories high. A few dirty hens 
		scattered into the open doors at our approach, but of human beings there 
		was no sign. The shutters of the unglazed windows were closed, and we 
		felt that we were in a village of the dead. As we squelched our way through 
		the mud between the houses and peered into every open door in the hope 
		of seeing someone alive, I was at last rewarded by catching a glimpse 
		of an old man asleep on a bench in the gloomy interior of his house, with 
		hens picking about his feet. We all peeped at him, the first Andorran 
		we had seen, the first human being the party had seen for three days. 
		The tiny fields on the steep terraced slopes above the village were deserted, 
		but stooks of recently harvested grain, often only two or three to a field, 
		were evidence of a laborious cultivation. Lo Serrat had nothing but the 
		Church and rude houses – no shop, no inn, no road connecting it with the 
		outside world. </P>
	  <P>We were 
		not disposed to waste any time there, and determined to push on to Ordino, 
		the first village on the motor road. We knew that there was an hotel there, 
		and we thought blissfully of baths, hot meals and beds as we descended 
		the mule-track down the Riu de Valira, eating as we walked. It was pouring 
		with rain, and too cold to make a halt pleasant. Fortunately we were well 
		supplied with food, and not dependent on the doubtful hospitality of Lo 
		Serrat. </P>
	  <P>We rested 
		two days in Ordino, chiefly in order to catch up with the ominous developments 
		in’ the international situation. It was difficult to arrive at the truth. 
		A few Frenchmen were staying at the hotel on a fishing holiday, and wild 
		rumours of declarations of war reverberated through the company. We could 
		never hear the wireless properly, owing to the violent arguments that 
		accompanied every news-bulletin, but we gathered enough to convince us 
		that Armageddon might be delayed long enough for us to see a little more 
		of Andorra before trying to get home. </P>
	  <P>Realizing 
		that travel is best restricted to the early morning and the evening in 
		the enervating heat of the Andorran valleys, we left Ordino with just 
		enough time to get us to Las Escaldea before sunset when the time came 
		to move on. We found a camp-site well above the town, and spent the next 
		morning visiting the capital, Andorra-la-Viella. While we were examining 
		the odd little parliament-house we found there, the care-taker appeared, 
		and asked if we would like to go inside. Beaming all over his face, he 
		produced a key, over a foot long and imposingly massive, and proceeded 
		to open the low, iron- bound door. He spoke little French, but waxed enthusiastic 
		in sign-language and Catalan as he showed us round the gloomy interior. 
		We saw the chapel, and the council chamber with its ancient wooden benches 
		and tables, for all the world like a schoolroom. We were then led into 
		the library, of perhaps two or three thousand volumes, largely French 
		and Spanish official publications, with a respectable section devoted 
		to agriculture. Justice was represented by the garotte, a fearful instrument, 
		still the official method of execution: but the Andorran is evidently 
		not given to homicide, for it was last used more than seventy years ago. 
		The kitchen, black with the smoke of centuries, boasted an enormous iron 
		cooking-pot slung from chains fixed to the roof, ready for a meal at the 
		next meeting of the Council. The cook must have an unenviable job, as 
		there is no chimney, and the smoke escapes through a hole in the roof. 
		In a small room off the council chamber hung the cocked hats and cloaks 
		of the councillors, which are handed down until they are no longer fit 
		for use. It was all very quaint, but somehow impressive, For Englishmen 
		like ourselves the spectacle of this mountain people continuing an ancient 
		tradition so akin to our own in its love of independence and self-government 
		was heartening. </P>
	  <P>We wandered 
		back along the dusty road to Las Escaldes for lunch at the Hotel Pl&acirc;, 
		and talked to the proprietress, who is one of the two or three people 
		in Andorra who can speak English. She remembered some friends of ours 
		who had stayed there six years before, and warned us not to repeat their 
		inglorious feat of getting lost in the attempt to reach Soldeu by way 
		of the Col dels Cortalls. We assured her that we would treat the complicated 
		geography with the respect that it deserved! It required a great effort 
		of will to don our heavy rucksacks and emerge into that scorching heat, 
		but we were determined to camp that night, and wanted to get well up the 
		Riu dels Cortalls that night. Our way lay through Encamp and La Mosquera, 
		which is as far from being a camper’s paradise as the second name suggests. 
		Every kind of biting insect in Andorra is reputed to congregate in that 
		region, and we had no intention of calling a halt until it was well in 
		the rear. </P>
	  <P>We left 
		the road at Encamp, and turned south-east into the mountains, zig-zagging 
		up the track between tiny fields, and resting frequently, for it was almost 
		unbearably hot. Soon we were in the pine-woods and approaching a pronounced 
		gorge. Another <I>yasse</I>, in fact, which opens out at its top into 
		the wide valley, almost a high plateau, of Cortalls d’Encamp. There was 
		little hope of climbing the gorge before nightfall, and we began to look 
		about for some fiat ground on which to pitch our teats – never a great 
		hope anywhere in Andorra, and almost a forlorn hope half-way up a <I>yasse</I>. 
		However, luck was with us. We spotted a ledge on which a log hut had been 
		built against the hillside on the other side of the gorge, and it looked 
		as if there might be room to pitch two tents. Clambering down to the stream, 
		and crossing it by way of a conveniently felled sapling, with great caution 
		– one falls into a torrent like that one once only – we soon reached the 
		ledge. There was room to pitch the tents, but the situation was airy in 
		the extreme, as it was only a couple of steps over the ledge to the stream, 
		two hundred feet below. </P>
	  <P>We did our 
		cooking in the hut, which was evidently used by lumbermen for the same 
		purpose, and spent an hour or two by a roaring fire, discussing the vexed 
		question of future plans. In view of the imminence of war, and the difficulty 
		we had . experienced in buying sufficient food to replenish our depleted 
		stocks, our plan for a camp in the mountains south of thc Col dels Cortalls 
		was regretfully abandoned. This was to have been the culmination of the 
		trip, and we had hoped to do some climbing in the area of the Cirque des 
		Pessons, the most remote and mountainous region in Andorra. However, we 
		had scarcely enough food for three days, even with rigid economy, which 
		would only allow us one day for climbing, assuming good weather. Mist 
		or bad weather would have made our position difficult once up in the mountains, 
		as the valleys are high and exposed, and we already knew how easy it was 
		to be mistaken about the time required for a journey worked out on the 
		map. The next day clinched our decision. It was so hot, even early in 
		the morning, that the mere thought of packing up to move on made us perspire.. 
		And it was an ideal situation in which to be idle. The view down the gorge 
		towards Encamp, the distant ridges fading into a haze under the deep blue 
		sky, and the rushing of the torrent below combined to produce a contemplative 
		frame of mind in which the threatening future and the discomforts of the 
		immediate past were reduced to their proper perspective. I often think 
		of our care-free hours on that absurd little ledge while the world was 
		going mad, and I am certain we were in the right place. It somehow sums 
		up for me the atmosphere of peace which has been so far off in the tension 
		of these tremendous years. </P>
	  <P>There was 
		the most violent thunderstorm I have ever experienced during the night, 
		but the next morning it was, if possible, even hotter. I had a mild attack 
		of sunstroke, in spite of the reasonable caution I thought I had exercised. 
		Insolation is markedly increased at seven thousand feet, and a short exposure 
		to the sun without protection is quite sufficient to produce unpleasant 
		after-effects. We left very early the next day and soon reached the top 
		of the gorge. The view to our right as we advanced higher up the wide 
		valley was tantalising – fantastic ridges and steep rocky peaks outlined 
		like jet against the southern sky. We resolved then and there that one 
		day we would return to explore this tempting district. A camp somewhere 
		south of the Col dels Cortalls could be supplied in a day from Encamp, 
		and would allow a party to sample the climbing on the peaks round the 
		Cirque des Pessons. The rock is of course much weathered, but there must 
		be plenty of mixed rock climbing for a party prepared to exercise caution 
		in a district which has never, to the best of my knowledge, been thoroughly 
		explored by climbers. </P>
	  <P>The Col 
		des Cortalls was easy, but we found some difficulty in establishing a 
		sound route down the valleys beyond the pass, so as to reach Soldeu, and 
		a party following the route in the reverse direction would have to take 
		a good deal of care, as it would be very easy to miss the pass. We tried 
		to take a short cut, which probably cost us two or three hours of unnecessary 
		scrambling over minor ridges, and confirmed our opinion that it is best 
		to stick to the valleys, even it if looks a long way round on the map. 
		</P>
	  <P>It was after 
		sunset when we reached Soldeu, but we found accommodation at a small modern 
		hotel which has replaced the inn of former years, and soon discovered 
		that the inter- national situation made a return to England imperative, 
		particularly as travel across France would be difficult with mobilisation 
		proceeding. We were unable to obtain enough food for two days, and decided 
		to rest at Soldeu and attempt to reach the first village in France by 
		a species of forced march via the pass of the Fontargente. War or no war, 
		we unanimously rejected the idea of leaving on the bus which ran by the 
		hotel door as completely beyond the pale. This question of food is very 
		important in Andorra. We found it extremely difficult to buy any reasonable 
		quantities, and any party intending to spend much time in the mountains 
		would be best advised to bring all they need with them. The ideal solution 
		would be to enter the country by car, and leave the vehicle either at 
		Soldeu or at Encamp. It would then be possible to spend a couple of days 
		bringing provisions up to a camp established south of the Col dels Cortalls, 
		thus enabling the party to live in the mountains for a worth-while period. 
		</P>
	  <P>We left 
		Soldeu very early, having rested the whole of the previous day, and made 
		good time up the Val d’Incl&egrave;s, which runs north-east from near 
		Soldeu to the French frontier, which is crossed by the Port de Fontargente, 
		9,300 feet. It is an easy pass from the Andorran side, but difficult to 
		find from the French side. However, there is a small lake immediately 
		below the col in the ridge which serves to distinguish it from thc numerous 
		false gaps in the ridge, and provides a safe key to the pass. We found 
		the descent involved some rather exhausting scrambling, and the next six 
		or seven miles required careful reference to map and compass, and even 
		more reliance on our own judgment, as the heavily hachured French map 
		seemed remarkably obscure. Once in the Val d’Aston, the rest was stiff 
		walking through an interminable pine-forest, following the river by rapids 
		and waterfalls through twenty miles of the finest wooded scenery any of 
		us had ever seen. An occasional bear is still shot in this region, and 
		it is wild enough to suggest a comparison with the Canadian Rockies. </P>
	  <P>We were 
		very tired when we reached the tiny village of Aston an hour after dark, 
		having covered about thirty miles, and having crossed a stiff pass into 
		the bargain. Our wanderings in Andorra were at an end. How we got back 
		to England just in time to hear the declaration of war is .html story. 
		But when the war is over, I shall go back to Andorra, It has possibilities. 
		</P>
