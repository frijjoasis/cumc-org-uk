		<H1>Harrison Rocks</H1><HR>

	  <P>IT is a 
		common complaint among those who live near London that there is no climbing 
		ground within reasonable distance of their homes, for, unlike those who 
		live in the Midlands, they have no gritstone outcrops where they can spend 
		their week- ends. In peacetime, when motor and faster rail transport were 
		available, Wales or even the Lake District was quite feasible on a normal 
		week-end; such visits, providing the regular practice which is so essential 
		in rock-climbing, are now almost impossible, and a satisfactory substitute 
		is hard to find. Thus it appears reasonable to devote space in this Journal 
		to what would in normal times be a rather trivial subject, namely a group 
		of rocks near Tunbridge Wells, which do provide a number of climbs; and 
		although admittedly much of their merit lies in their accessibility, the 
		climbs are of real interest, and certainly deserve attention. </P>
	  <P>Of late 
		the number of climbing visitors to these rocks has been increasing, and 
		has included a few Cambridge parties. To these and any others who may 
		be intending to spend a day on Harrison Rocks, some brief notes on the 
		type of climbing to bc expected may be of use, though anything in the 
		nature of a complete guide would be giving the rocks a status they do 
		not deserve. Two guidebooks have already been written on them: one by 
		the Mountaineering section of the Camping Club of Great Britain, and the 
		other by Mr. Courtney Bryson. Both are now out of print. In addition to 
		the section on Harrison Rocks, Mr. Bryson’s book also contains information 
		on several other rock outcrops in the district, none of which are really 
		worth a separate visit, unless one happens to live nearby. </P>
	  <P>The first 
		things the prospective visitor will want to know are the exact whereabouts 
		of the rocks, and the easiest way of reaching them from London. They lie 
		about six miles to the south of Tunbridge Wells, and as they are not marked 
		on the Ordnance Survey map, it is as well to obtain directions locally 
		for the last stage of the journey. They are best approached from Groombridge 
		Station, from which they are perhaps half an hour’s walk. Trains from 
		Victoria to this station and to Tunbridge Wells are frequent, if not fast. 
		The rocks are situated on a hillside, at the edge of a wood, and although 
		they are fairly well known to the local inhabitants, one is not much disturbed 
		by sightseers or picnickers. Most climbing parties spend only one day 
		here, returning home the same evening, but there is a really excellent 
		cave, dry and well provided with firewood. It will hold three people in 
		comfort, and is well known to habitu&eacute;s of the rocks. Apart from 
		this rather primitive shelter, the nearest accommodation is at Tunbridge 
		Wells, the inn at Eridge station being of interest only to the thirsty. 
		</P>
	  <P>The rocks 
		themselves form a continuous cliff a quarter of a mile or so in length, 
		and averaging thirty feet high. The rock is sandstone, but hard of its 
		kind, and firm. Consequently rubbers are the normal, and in fact the only 
		suitable, footgear, boots being both useless and damaging to the holds. 
		As the cliff is composed of a number of rounded bulges set one on top 
		of .html, there are few incut holds, and overhangs are much in evidence. 
		As a result, the face climbs are as hard as, or harder than, they look, 
		and exposed after a fashion. The general structure of the buttress is 
		seamed with cracks and chimneys, and laybacks are very common. A characteristic 
		feature is the number of narrow passages running back from the cliff frontage, 
		often for a considerable distance. These are narrow, with vertical walls, 
		and while their grassy floors make paths to the top, the passages themselves 
		make excellent chimneys. In one or two cases, two or more converging passages 
		sever a buttress completely from the rest of the cliff, and in one such 
		at least the top is accessible only by climbing, or by jumping across 
		the passage, a somewhat frightening procedure. </P>
	  <P>There are 
		about thirty climbs known to the present writer, but many of these scarcely 
		deserve a mention, because they are either too short or too uninteresting, 
		occasionally both. Nearly all the better climbs are hard, certainly worthy 
		of a better name than boulder problems, and although it is of course impossible 
		to classify them, it may be said that most would certainly be &quot;severe&quot; 
		or &quot;very severe&quot; by Welsh standards. It is the custom here to 
		climb on a rope held from above, and this is undoubtedly wise in most 
		cases, until one has mastered the many trick moves that abound, Strong 
		fingers are a great asset. Several of the harder climbs have never been 
		led. </P>

		   Long Layback</DIV> 
		
	  
	  The short list 
	  of climbs that follows may be of interest to those who are going there for 
	  the first time, but the exact position of each is difficult to describe, 
	  since the cliff changes so little throughout its length, and possesses few 
	  unmistakable landmarks. From Groombridge the approach is along a small lane 
	  leading through the wood in which the rocks lie. At first they are low and 
	  shut in by trees, but as one follows the path along the bottom they increase 
	  in height and become more open. Two or three hundred yards from this end 
	  there is a very obvious landmark, a buttress projecting in a series of overhangs, 
	  and slightly suggestive, perhaps, of the mouth of some prehistoric fish. 
	  This is Luncheon Ledge, and is the ’ centre of a number of good climbs. 
	  The ledge itself may be reached by a climb called Long Layback, which goes 
	  up a pair of twin cracks in the corner, followed by a stomach traverse along 
	  a narrow ledge, or the cracks in the corner may be followed to the top past 
	  an overhanging chockstone. This part of the climb is extremely hard and 
	  has never been finished without the aid of a rope. On the other side of 
	  Luncheon Ledge is a twenty-foot slab, set at a high angle, which at first 
	  sight appears quite impossible. Closer inspection reveals a number of small 
	  holds, and the slab makes a hard balance problem. Besides those mentioned, 
	  there are several obvious cracks and chimneys at this end of the cliff, 
	  which provide climbing of a varying degree of interest and difficulty. <BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
	   
	  <P>

		   Long Crack</DIV> 
		
	  
	  The next climb 
	  of note, possibly one of the best on the outcrop, is Long Crack, which lies 
	  about fifty yards further on, and has an overhanging start. It is best climbed 
	  facing left as a layback. Just as the situation appears critical, a foothold 
	  can be reached far out on the left, The conquest of this overhang is the 
	  crux of the climb, and beyond it all is relatively straightforward. There 
	  is little worthy of special mention for about two hundred yards beyond this 
	  point, when the climber reaches a large buttress with a fallen tree leaning 
	  against it. Most of this buttress is overhanging to a degree unusual even 
	  on Harrison Rocks, but its far side leans at a rather more accommodating 
	  angle, and up it runs a climb called Rowan Tree Wall. In the corner is a 
	  passage of the type peculiar to this district, whose entrance is guarded 
	  by a holly tree, and the climb starts rather uncomfortably behind this, 
	  traversing out along a line of holds. From here a pull-up on small holds 
	  lands one on somewhat easier rock, and this is climbed to the top, where 
	  there is a large tree which provides a belay.  
	  
	  <P>The next 
		seventy yards of rock are dirty and usually wet, though they probably 
		have climbs on them. At the far end of this section is a nose of rock, 
		partly transformed into an island by a deep passage. The corner of this 
		buttress has a curious shape, and is known as Wellington’s Nose. By chimneying 
		up the outside of the passage, one can move on to the buttress where it 
		lies back at a feasible angle; above this is a big overhang, which gives 
		the climb its name. There are good holds above, and the overhang is short, 
		so that the move is not as hard as it appears. Further along the passage 
		the walls are narrow and straight right up to the top, and simple back-and- 
		knee work will suffice the whole way. <BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
		
	  <P>
	  
		 
		   <DIV Align="center"><IMG SRC="ISOLATE.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="457" ALT="Isolated Buttress" BORDER="1"><BR> 
		   Isolated Buttress</DIV> 
		
	  
	  From Wellington’s 
	  Nose the path at the foot of the cliff winds its way along for some distance, 
	  past various small climbs, until it reaches Isolated Buttress, a very conspicuous 
	  island of rock, completely cut off from the main cliff, whose summit can 
	  only be reached by climbing or by jumping across the passage at the back. 
	  This passage is roofed over at one end by a large chockstone, which may 
	  easily be reached by chimneying., From the chockstone the top of the buttress 
	  is attainable with the aid of a small tree, which it is rather a struggle 
	  to reach. This tree is also the belay for the other climbs on Isolated Buttress, 
	  of which there are two. One of these runs up the well-marked left-hand edge 
	  of the buttress, star6ng directly below the large overhanging boulder at 
	  the top. It is broken near the top by a ledge, on which there used to be 
	  a tree, just below the overhang. All that is left of the tree is a broken 
	  stump, as the weight of many climbers has proved too much for it. The ledge 
	  is reached by climbing the corner on small holds, finishing with a layback 
	  for a foot or two. Here, the prospect brightens, but perhaps deceptively. 
	  The overhanging boulder is above and to the left, and makes a corner with 
	  the main buttress, in which is a thin crack about eight feet high. This 
	  crack is probably the hardest part of the climb, since it gives the climber 
	  the sensation of being pushed out. The secret of success is to stand on 
	  the tree stump and reach for a high handhold in the crack. As a climb this 
	  is quite leadable, though best done on a rope first. It is about the longest 
	  and best climb on the rocks.  
	  
	  <P>Fifty yards 
		beyond Isolated Buttress is a large cave with a partially deficient roof. 
		This is known as Big Cave, and many excellent scrambles are to be had 
		both inside and outside it. The best is a right-angled crack beyond it, 
		which may be climbed by a layback to the floor of a small cave formed 
		by a fallen block. The difficulty lies in the move out of this, the only 
		available hold being out of sight and at least a foot higher than the 
		average man’s reach. </P>
	  <P>The rocks 
		beyond this point become broken and overgrown for perhaps fifty yards, 
		until Half-Crown Corner is reached. This is a curious horizontal groove 
		five feet from the ground, and the problem is to cross it from left to 
		right and then ascend the buttress beyond. The best method to adopt in 
		the scoop, which is now heavily marked by those who have fallen out, is 
		to press with one’s head against the roof, and use a very sloping foothold 
		for one’s feet. As the present writer has never succeeded in getting any 
		further than this point, he has little knowledge of the rest of the climb. 
		It looks very hard. The climb was so named after a bet, and legend has 
		it that the bet was won. If so, half-a-crown seems a wholly inadequate 
		sum. <BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
		
	  <P>
	  
		 
		   <DIV Align="center"><IMG SRC="HELLWALL.jpg" WIDTH="400" HEIGHT="392" ALT="Hell Wall" BORDER="1"><BR> 
		   Hell Wall </DIV>
		
	  
	  Beyond Half-.crown 
	  Corner the rocks as a climbing ground really end, as they dwindle to a line 
	  of boulders a few feet high. Before they finally disappear, however, they 
	  excel themselves in providing one wall of almost incredible fierceness, 
	  which is seldom climbed, though frequently attempted. It is now fairly generally 
	  known as Hell Wall, a name originally given to a small buttress just beyond 
	  it, and it consists of an almost vertical wall, twenty-five or thirty feet 
	  high, and pitted only with a few finger holds; It is best started at the 
	  left-hand end. If the climber is wise, and dislikes being lowered ignominiously 
	  on a rope, he will remain a spectator.  
	  
	  <P>Further 
		along than this, nothing but a few scrambles will be found, the best being 
		perhaps a twenty-five foot boulder, which lies off the main path, nearer 
		the road, and behind some cottages. </P>
	  <P>It should 
		be emphasised that this short list by no means exhausts the practice climbs 
		to be found on Harrison Rocks, but merely enumerates those considered 
		the best, and it is hoped that it may give someone who has never been 
		there an idea of what to expect. Once he has become used to the type of 
		climb to be found here, and the somewhat unusual techniques employed, 
		he will soon notice a large number of other climbs which have not been 
		mentioned; and will find that there is quite sufficient to send him home 
		after a day’s climbing with aching fingers, which are the usual sequel 
		to a visit to Harrison Rocks. </P>
