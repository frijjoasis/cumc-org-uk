		<H1>An Attempt on Gardyloo</H1><HR>
		<H2>A. R. C. Butson</H2>

	  <P>THE C.U.M.C. 
		meet on Nevis was nearly over when Mike Pybus and I decided to climb Gardyloo 
		Gully. Gardyloo is one of the steepest of the Ben’s gullies, and in summer 
		forms a rock climb of great severity. However, in winter, when filled 
		in with ice and snow, its character is greatly changed and it provides 
		two unique features, namely, a large chockstone under which it may be 
		possible to pass by means of an ice tunnel; and above this, in most winters, 
		an overhanging ice bulge, the difficulty of which changes from day to 
		day, it being a relatively easy ice problem one day and an impasse the 
		next. </P>
	  <P>We made 
		a late start, and it was noon before Mite and I had left the S.M.C. hut 
		in the Alt a’ Mhuilin glen. The other party of three had set off up a 
		climb on the Trident. Observatory Gully was icy, and although a party 
		had been up it only three days previously, fresh steps had to be cut. 
		At the foot of Gardyloo Gully we decided to rope up, but through careless 
		handling the coil of rope was dropped and went careering down Observatory 
		Gully. I started off after it and glissaded to the bottom without seeing 
		it. Having descended fifteen hundred feet already, I thought I might as 
		well go on down to the hut and collect .html rope. In climbing up to 
		the foot of Gardyloo for the second time I found the first rope, lodged 
		out of sight in an avalanche runnel. Mite, meanwhile, had been laboriously 
		cutting steps up Gardyloo. We roped up and ascended slowly as the snow 
		was ice-hard and only the pick of the axe made any impression on it. As 
		we reached the small snow platform below the tunnel we both remarked that 
		it would make quite a reasonable place for a night out, little knowing 
		how narrowly we were to escape such a fate. The tunnel, being fairly free 
		of snow, was passed through easily. Seventy feet beyond, we were under 
		the notorious ice-bulge – twenty-five feet high, greenish- black, overhanging 
		and bearded with icicles. On either side the walls of the gully rose precipitous 
		and ice-bound. Mist swirled in the gully., making it appear an enormous 
		vertical funnel of ice. Every now and then through a gap in the mist the 
		slopes of Carn Mor Dearg opposite loomed up eerily. The ice-bulge is only 
		a hundred and twenty feet from the summit, and the other party, when they 
		reached the top, bellowed abuse and exhortations down into our gully. 
		We replied in like manner. </P>
	  <P>Mike began 
		the attack on the ice-bulge from the side, with vigour. He used the piton 
		hammer to good effect, but subjected myself to a barrage of heavy blocks 
		of ice, which was not over soothing to my temper. He climbed eight feet 
		up the side of the bulge and then moved out on to its overhanging face. 
		Twelve feet up, his foot, which had developed a distracting clonus, started 
		to slip on the ice and only a rapid withdrawal prevented disaster. After 
		that we took it in turns to hack holds on the bulge, but the going was 
		very difficult as hand- holds in overhanging ice are hard to use and one’s 
		hands rapidly become numb. We managed, however, to reach. a point from 
		which we could see over the top of the bulge, but suddenly we became aware 
		of approaching darkness. We did not have a watch with us, but we must 
		have spent four hours battering at the bulge. We were faced with making 
		the decision between forcing the bulge, after which a formidable cornice 
		would have to be tunnelled, and retracing our steps down steep ice slopes 
		in the dark without a torch. Disappointed, we decided to retreat. We ate 
		some chocolate, our first meal for twelve hours, and descended as fast 
		as possible in the murky gloom, each man leading through in two-hundred 
		foot pitches. A storm was coming up and cascades of surface snow had filled 
		up our steps cut on the ascent. Once, when I was the full length of the 
		rope below Mike, I heard a clattering sound and saw him careering down 
		the gully attempting to dig the pick of his axe into ice. I prepared myself 
		for the shock. When he was about level with me, Mike succeeded in jamming 
		himself across an avalanche runnel. This was fortunate as there was a 
		nasty drop over a rock face below us. This episode made us continue with 
		greater caution; but searching for hidden steps while descending on ice, 
		in the dark, is tedious and exhausting and is always fraught with danger. 
		</P>
	  <P>It was approaching 
		midnight by now and we could faintly hear the others calling from Coire 
		Leas fifteen hundred feet below. They had descended to the hut, and 6nding 
		us still out, had waited for some time and then set out as a search party’. 
		Our progress by now was very slow, as we were bitterly cold and the strain 
		of our method of progression was telling. My thoughts concentrated on 
		how we should fare for the rest of the night roped to our axes on the 
		ice slope. The prospect was unsavoury in the extreme. Then I heard Gordon 
		Donaldson yelling in the corrie below. Soon we were able to make out his 
		&quot; Will o’ the Wisp&quot; headlamp, coming up the slope at an inhuman 
		pace. In due course he reached us, complete with rucksack containing splints, 
		bandages and rum. Only the last of these was utilised. After this we descended 
		rapidly, in comparison with our previous .rate, as we were guided by Gordon’s 
		headlamp, while ’he himself stood out on the ice- slope and pranced about 
		on tricounis, chamois-fashion, All the time the wind was getting fiercer 
		and a blizzard threatened. Once a mighty roar from the black precipices 
		above us momentarily struck terror into our hearts. Various oaths were 
		uttered as we realised that part of the cornice had avalanched. Fortunately 
		only a few hundredweight of frozen debris came shooting down the gully 
		and caused no harm. </P>
	  <P>We descended, 
		without sense of time, till I saw a black mass looming up below me. The 
		same mass was blaspheming vigorously ’and demanding that vast quantities 
		of the rum be poured down an expiring throat. It was Rick, who duly drank 
		the remainder of the precious beverage. He and John had been digging large 
		steps for us so that the lower part of Observatory Gully was rapidly descended. 
		Once back in the S.M.C. hut a good brew of stew and &quot; Mummery’s Blood 
		&quot; brought back a sense of gastronomic security. Lying in my bunk, 
		warm and replete with stew, I listened to the wind shrieking down the 
		frozen gullies and round the crags and wondered just what it was like 
		up there. I did not worry for long. </P>
	  <P>Moral? Take 
		a torch as there is not always a yodelling mountain dervish with one to 
		help you. [Thoughtful readers may discover others. – Ed.]</P>
