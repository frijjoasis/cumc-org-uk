		<H1>THE CAIRNGORMS</H1><HR>
		<H2>R. H. GOODY</H2>
		<H3>St. John's</H3>
	  
	  <P>THE Cairngorm 
		Range cannot be recommended as providing any climbing of difficulty such 
		as is provided by the Lochaber mountains on the other end of the Grampian 
		Chain. It is a district for hill-walking and if it is considered as such, 
		it is perfect territory for the climber who can find pleasure in living 
		amongst and walking upon high hills far from all signs and traces of humanity. 
		</P>
	  <P>The range 
		itself is characterised by the height of its peaks, many of which are 
		over four thousand feet, and by the magnificent valleys which intersect 
		it.. The actual mountains are rounded and covered mainly with grass and 
		scree, but their slopes are usually relieved by huge corries filled with 
		scree, bordered by faces of rotten and tottering rock, and often containing 
		snow throughout the year. The peaks command magnificent views; either 
		to the North or South one of the great valleys of the Dee or Don, which 
		border the Range, will be open to view, ahd from. the bleak hillside they 
		seem very green and inviting. These valleys may be only a few miles distant, 
		but they seem to be completely detached from the world of ridges and rock 
		plateaux of the Cairngorm summits. As one stands in the evening upon Braeriach, 
		for example, the grey slopes below seem to form a hiatus on the far side 
		of which the Don valley appears as a golden-green oasis, bordered and 
		intersected by the dark green bands of Rothiemurchus Forest, against the 
		vague purple background of the Monadliaths. Thc highest hills fall into 
		groups, each group making a fine ridge walk. The three main groups, which 
		can easily be picked out from a map, are Cairn Toul, Angels’ Peak and 
		Braeriach; Ben Macdhui and Cairngorm; and Beinn a Bhuird and Ben Avon. 
		But, as may also be seen from a map, the distances are long and the energy 
		involved in a traverse may be considerable. During the winter months, 
		the peaks become more impressive, and distances even more difficult to 
		cover. I have no experience of winter conditions in the Cairngorms but 
		I gather that there is good snow and ice climbing and that ski running 
		is a fairly popular sport. </P>
	  <P>From what 
		has been said, the difficulties of the Cairngorms will not appear to be 
		very great; but numerous fatal accidents testify to the care which must 
		be taken by all, whether familiar with the range or not. Accidents normally 
		seem to be due to exhaustion brought about either by the weather, by carrying 
		unsuitable equipment, or by the climber becoming lost. Chances of being 
		rescued, except from Cairngorm itself, or Gem the Lairig Ghru, are negligible. 
		I know of one beginner who, contrary to all advice, attempted to reach 
		the Shelter Stone with unsuitable footwear. ’He arrived back at Aviemore 
		having been without food for thirty-six hours, his. shoes had disintegrated 
		upon a sharp scree slope, his feet were cut and bleeding and he was generally 
		in a state of extreme exhaustion. It had taken him several hours to cover 
		the last few miles. A less hardy individual would probably not have survived 
		at all. The warning at the front of the S.M.C. Guide to the Cairngorms, 
		is, perhaps, slightly exaggerated, but those whose experience is only 
		of English hills would do well to take it seriously. </P>
	  <P>The most 
		notable of the Cairngorm Valleys are the Lairig Ghru, the Lairig an Laoigh, 
		Glen Feshie, Glen Enich and the Avon Valley, and the first three of these 
		form passes from Braemar to Aviemore. All these Valleys are well worth 
		exploring, but reference can only be made to three of them here. </P>
	  <P>The Lairig 
		Ghru passes between the highest mountains of the range, and has at its 
		summit the source of the River Dee. Since the Lairig is the shortest route 
		from Braemar to Aviemore, it is normally rather populous, that is to say, 
		on a 6ne day three or four parties may make use of it. Those who have 
		not made the journey usually refer to it as an easy walk, and this attitude 
		is perhaps the reason why I once found three middle-aged ladies stranded 
		at the centre of the pass late one summer’s evening. They spent the night 
		in the Corrour bothie and it is presumed that by some means they managed 
		to complete by far the worst half of the journey the next day. The summit 
		of the pass is extremely rough going, being a wilderness of sharp blocks 
		of rock. The climber passing this spot is well advised to take a catapult 
		if he is proficient with the weapon, for if he sits down at the summit 
		for any length of time he will undoubtedly become aware of a number of 
		innocent-looking ptarmigan perched unconcernedly upon the rocks, depending 
		upon their natural camouflage for protection. They can provide a useful 
		supply of fresh meat. </P>
	  <P>The Lairig 
		an Laoigh is longer and less imposing than the Lairig Ghru and it is very 
		rarely used. This pass is bordered by Ben MacDhui and Cairngorm on one 
		side and by Ben Avon and Beinn a Bhuird on the other, but the mountains 
		do not crowd in so closely as they do in the Lairig Ghru. The whole pass 
		is wild and desolate and the path cheerfully makes its way through rocks, 
		bogs and long-tufted grass. At its mid point it crosses the Avon Valley 
		and this can involve a cold and unpleasant crossing of the river if there 
		has been much rain. The Lairig an Laoigh can be left at this point and 
		the Avon Valley followed up to the Shelter Stone by Loch Avon or down 
		’ to civilisation at Cockbridge or Tomintoul. The Shelter Stone is, by 
		the way, a rather crude natural shelter, made reasonably comfortable by 
		its users. The surroundings are very rugged and it is possible that some 
		rock climbing might be had in this district. </P>
	  <P>The Cairngorms 
		have, in the past, been used for deer and grouse shooting and this fact 
		accounts for the number of deserted keepers’ huts and cottages that are 
		scattered about the Valleys. These huts can be very useful to the climber 
		as bases, and for any protracted tour they provide the only possible accommodation. 
		Apart from the Corrour bothie these shelters are not generally known and 
		a knowledge of which have roofs and which have fuel supplies, and so on, 
		can usually only be gained by word of mouth. This procedure is due to 
		the fact that the shelters are probably privately owned, and the owners 
		might not approve of their public use. I shall therefore only describe 
		the Corrour bothie. It is situated at the foot of the Devil’s Point in 
		the Lairig Ghru, and since it is about a quarter of a mile off the path, 
		the few users of the Lairig pass unnoticed and are not tempted to disturb 
		one’s privacy. The Dee has to be crossed in order to get to the bothie. 
		This can be done by way of stepping stones. by the light-hearted, but 
		the more serious individual is advised to wade – a drier method in the 
		long run. The bothie is a small stone hut which at one time was sparsely 
		furnished, but all the furniture, other than an old table, has been used 
		for firewood; several large boulders and a 5 gallon oil can have apparently 
		proved to be uninflammable. The floor is made of peat which makes a very 
		comfortable surface on which to sleep. Facilities include an axe, some 
		food, candles, matches, wood, and, unfortunately, rats. These rate are 
		very bold creatures, but do not let your companion take this as an excuse 
		for sleeping with the axe beside him, or perhaps you will awake, as I 
		once did, to find him leaning over you with the axe poised. To be awakened 
		in this manner has a very disturbing effect, even though he may protest 
		that there was a rat near your head. </P>
	  <P>When I first 
		visited the Corrour bothie, the only wood available was a piece of hard 
		red pine knotted and gnarled with age. The axe was blunt and patient effort 
		for about two hours produced scarcely enough fuel to boil a billycan of 
		water to make the inevitable tea. The surroundings are so free from vegetation 
		that I could not understand where even this old piece of pine had been 
		obtained. The day after our efforts with the pine log, my companion and 
		I carried about a hundred-weight of wood between the two of us from Derry 
		Lodge, which is four miles away, involving a tremendous effort at the 
		end of a long day. It was not until after this that we read in the Visitor’s 
		Book that the peat bogs which cover the floor of the Valley are full of 
		old and decaying pine trees. Wood is just outside the front door, but 
		you have to dig for it. </P>
	  <P>The bothie 
		is well situated from the climber's point of view. In the morning there 
		is an inevitable mist, but if the day is to be fine, the mist will clear 
		suddenly about nine o’clock to reveal an impressive sight. Ben MacDhui 
		and Cairn Toul, high above, are bathed in sunlight that has not yet penetrated 
		to the bottom of the valley. Northwards is the summit of the pass and, 
		beyond, the grey tops of the Monadliaths; while to the South, Glen Tilt 
		falls away into the morning haze. The only disturbing factors in the scene 
		are the harsh cries of the ptarmigan and the cold wind which sends one 
		rapidly back to help cook the breakfast. </P>
	  <P>Cooking 
		is, of necessity, primitive. My memories are mainly of brose-oatmeal and 
		butter mixed in a plate with boiling water; pea-soup stew, an excuse for 
		mixing everything; blaeberries, picked from the hillside, their fine taste 
		enhanced by the effort necessary to pick them; and, of course, tea, probably 
		without milk or sugar. </P>
	  <P>The least 
		tangible feature of the Cairngorms is the number of ghosts, spectres and 
		bogies which inhabit the range; a number altogether disproportionate to 
		that possessed by other districts in Scotland. One member of the C.U.M.C. 
		at least has assured me of his personal acquaintance with a witch and 
		one, other unnamed spirit. Perhaps the best-known bogy is the Grey Man 
		of Ben MacDhui. He will follow behind you with long slow footsteps as 
		you trudge down the slopes of-the Ben. I have myself had a feeling of 
		being followed downwards, but being rather sceptical I am inclined to 
		attribute this to the grey mist steadily closing in behind. As for the 
		rest of the stories, the desolation of the long slopes, the eerie cries 
		of the birds and the general background of accidents in past history, 
		probably account for a good deal. </P>
	  <P>Perhaps 
		I have not succeeded in sketching a picture of the Cairngorms which is 
		particularly attractive to the climber, but, nevertheless, I have been 
		there several times and shall undoubtedly go again. The range has a strong 
		appeal, although as this article shows, one can spend many weeks there 
		with few incidents and no climbing particularly worthy of mention. I have 
		tried to avoid giving descriptions of definite features of the Cairngorms, 
		because of the existence of the excellent Guide issued by the Scottish 
		Mountaineering Club, which deals with every point in great detail, and 
		which, together with the Ordnance Survey Map and the Youth Hostels Handbook, 
		provides all possible information. </P>
