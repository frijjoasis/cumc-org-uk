    <h3>Kinds of outdoor meet</h3>,
    <p>
        Every weekend (weather permitting) we’ll drive up to the Peak District (usually) to a crag selected by the
        outdoor meet secs. This is the “standard” outdoor meet, and are always a lot of fun! These trips last a whole
        day, leaving at 0700 sharp and get back in the evening sometime, depending on the time of year. We’ll look at
        the preferences of those that sign up, as well as the weather forecast, to choose whether we go on Saturday or
        Sunday.

        Once a term we also try and go away for a weekend somewhere. In the past, we’ve had weekends in North Wales or
        the Peak District, but if you’ve got a favourite place to go then let us know! We usually book a bunkhouse out
        for these trips so we don’t need to camp. As well as some fantastic climbing, you can expect a nice meal and
        lots of bunkhouse fun and games! The ever-popular sock wrestling or table mountaineering are bound to make an
        appearance at some point over the weekend! We also now have a special CUMC edition of Cards Against Humanity,
        endorsed by current and former presidents of the Club."

        The pinnacle of outdoor meets happens after May Week every year: the annual meet. This is a week long trip
        somewhere far from Cambridge: in the past we’ve been to places such as Cornwall, North Wales, and
        Pembrokeshire. Signup for this normally opens around the start of Easter term, so keep on the lookout around
        then for more details!

        We also run a 'Winter Sun' trip. This happens soon after Michaelmas term ends and sees the club travel off to
        somewhere nice and sunny (unlike the UK in December!) for a week’s sport climbing. In the past we've been to
		Antalya in Turkey and El Chorro in Spain - who knows where we’ll go this year?

    <h3>What kind of climbing happens on outdoor meets?</h3>,
    <p>
        Since the majority of the trips take place in the Peak District, trad climbing is the standard. There’s also
        lots of bouldering up there, so if you fancy that let the outdoor meet sec organising the trip know. Whether
        it’s possible or not depends on if there’s room in the car for a boulder pad! If you’re a super keen sport
        climber let us know and we’ll see if we can try and organise a trip more to your tastes.

    <h3>What you need to know</h3>,
    <p>
        We require that those going on outdoor meets know how to LEAD BELAY. If you don’t, then you’ll spend lots of
        the day sitting around and won’t have a good time. Or worse, someone might get hurt. We can teach you the
        skills you need though: generally indoor meets are a good time for this. If you want to learn to lead trad then
        we’re happy to show you (we usually run one meet per term geared towards this), but it’s definitely best if you
        learn to lead indoors first or you may find it a little scarier than expected!

    <h3>How much do they cost?</h3>,
    <p>
        This year, outdoor meets cost £15. Everyone pays this to the club, then the driver can claim back 25p per mile
        to cover petrol and a small amount of “wear and tear”. If you signup to a meet, have your place confirmed then
        find you can no longer go then email the organiser BEFORE 10AM on the Friday and they will refund you. No
        refunds will be given after this time except in exceptional circumstances. If the entire meet is cancelled then
        everyone will be refunded.
    </p>,

    <h3>What to bring</h3>,
    <p>
        These trips happen throughout the year, so clearly this varies. As a bare minimum you’ll need a harness,
        helmet, belay plate and climbing shoes on top of the stuff you’d normally take on a day out to the countryside
        (warm clothes, sturdy shoes, lunch etc.). If you have climbing gear, such as your own rack or rope, that you’re
        prepared to use then please bring them along. The club have some gear that can be lent to members, but if you
        have your own then you’re likely to want to use it anyway! However you use personal gear on meets at your own
        risk; the club won't cover the cost of damage or loss.
