        The club has it's weekly social at a local pub, usually somewhere with a good ale selection, straight after the
        weekly Kelsey Kerridge meet on a Monday night. We head to the pub around 9pm, so listen out for the Call to Beer
        if you're at the wall, or feel free to meet us at the pub if not! Look out for the weekly email which
        will let you know which pub we'll be at (COVID dependent!). As well as this,
        there are frequent extra social events throughout the year, such as our christmas formal, annual dinner and
        swaps with other societies.
