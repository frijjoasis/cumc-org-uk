        The club has its weekly social at a local pub, straight after the
        weekly Kelsey Kerridge meet on a Monday night. We head to the pub around 9pm, so listen out for the Call to Beer
        if you're at the wall, or feel free to meet us at the pub if not! Keep an eye on the
		 Whatsapp chat to see
		which pub we'll be heading to. As well as this,
        there are weekly social events throughout the year, such as movie nights, our annual dinner and
        swaps with other societies. You can find this term's termcard on our
