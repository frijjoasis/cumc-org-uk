        Every Friday evening we run a trip to a nearby indoor wall, this is your chance to get on a rope inside or just
        to do some extra bouldering. We rotate between a selection of walls around an hour's drive away (usually The
        Pinnacle in Northampton, Big Rock in Milton Keynes and XC in Hemel Hempstead). They all have excellent leading,
        top roping and bouldering so there's something for everyone. We leave from Cambridge at around 6pm and usually
        climb to closing time so get back around 11pm.</p>,

        To come sign up on the website. This opens on a Monday when the president sends out the weekly bulletin. Any
        club member can come on an indoor meet. This year indoor meets cost Â£6 which is used to refund drivers at a
        rate of 25p per mile, which covers fuel plus 'wear and tear'. This doesn't cover the cost of entry to the wall!
        If you have your place on a meet confirmed then find you can't come email the organiser BEFORE 10AM on the
        Friday and they will refund you. No refunds will be given after this time except in exceptional circumstances.
        If the entire meet is cancelled then everyone will be refunded.
