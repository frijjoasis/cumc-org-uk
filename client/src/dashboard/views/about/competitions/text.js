        Here you can learn more about the competitions we'll be running and taking part in over the year. Further
        information on all these events will be released nearer the time, and the calendar will be regularly updated
        for forward planning. We have ordered the competition types to reflect how serious and challenging they are.

    <h3>Cuppers</h3>,
    <p>
        This is our Inter-Collegiate competition, which will take place at Rainbow Rocket each term. You will be given
        a score sheet of problems to climb: tick them off as you go and write whether or not you did it on your first
        attempt too. You'll have a few weeks to try all the climbs and get as many done as you can. Once you've
        finished, submit your score as the score sheet instructs. The results will be announced shortly after the
        competition period has ended. There will be a large range in the difficulty of the problems chosen so there is
        no need for previous competition experience. The winning college will be presented with our Cuppers trophy.

    <h3>Varsity</h3>,
    <p>
        A competition where we take on Oxford! Date and venue will be announced nearer the time, but will probably take
        place at a wall in London during Lent term. There is no limit to how many people we can enter, so let's get as
        big a team as possible! This is fairly relaxed, so try it out if you're new to climbing competitions.

    <h3>London University Bouldering Event (LUBE)</h3>,
    <p>
        These are a series of competitions which are run by London universities and take place in centres around
        London. We can enter a team of 8 (minimum 2 of each gender). The usual plan is to take the train down together,
        compete, and return the same afternoon. No competition experience is required, although we will select on
        ability if oversubscribed.

    <h3>BUCS</h3>,
    <p>
        The national bouldering competition! This will be in Sheffield at some point in Lent term, and a small group of
        us will be able to compete. This is a serious competition, and club members will gain most from the experience
        if they are regular competitors.
