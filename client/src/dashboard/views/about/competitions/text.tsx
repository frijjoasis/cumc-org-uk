    Here you can learn more about the competitions we'll be running and taking
    part in over the year. Further information on all these events will be
    released nearer the time, and the calendar will be regularly updated for
    forward planning. We have ordered the competition types to reflect how
    serious and challenging they are.

    Cuppers
  </h3>,
  <p>
    This is our Inter-Collegiate competition, which will take place at Rainbow
    Rocket each term. You will be given a score sheet of problems to climb: tick
    them off as you go and write whether or not you did it on your first attempt
    too. You'll have a few weeks to try all the climbs and get as many done as
    you can. Once you've finished, submit your score as the score sheet
    instructs. The results will be announced shortly after the competition
    period has ended. There will be a large range in the difficulty of the
    problems chosen so there is no need for previous competition experience. The
    winning college will be presented with our Cuppers trophy.

    Varsity
  </h3>,
  <p>
    A competition where we take on Oxford! Date and venue will be announced
    nearer the time, but will probably take place at a wall in London during
    Lent term. There is no limit to how many people we can enter, so let's get
    as big a team as possible! This is fairly relaxed, so try it out if you're
    new to climbing competitions.

    London University Bouldering Event (LUBE)
  </h3>,
  <p>
    These are a series of competitions which are run by London universities and
    take place in centres around London. We can enter a team of 8 (minimum 2 of
    each gender). The usual plan is to take the train down together, compete,
    and return the same afternoon. No competition experience is required,
    although we will select on ability if oversubscribed.

  <h3 className="text-lg font-black uppercase tracking-tight text-primary pt-4">
    BUCS
  </h3>,
  <p>
    The national bouldering competition! This will be in Sheffield at some point
    in Lent term, and a small group of us will be able to compete. This is a
    serious competition, and club members will gain most from the experience if
    they are regular competitors.
