        <h2><strong>CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY MOUNTAINEERING CLUB CONSTITUTION</strong></h2>
    </p>,
    <p>
        Proposed November 2024
    </p>,
    <p>
        <h3><strong>I. General</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The name of the Society shall be “Cambridge University Mountaineering Club” hereafter referred to as “the Club” or “CUMC”.</li>
            <li>That the Club and its members shall abide all rules, regulations and other requirements of the BMC and any institution within which they climb.</li>
            <li>That the objectives of the Club are:
                <ol>
                    <li>To promote the interests in climbing and mountaineering amongst members of the Club and University.</li>
                    <li>To promote and provide an opportunity for members of the Club to meet and participate in climbing and mountaineering activities together.</li>
                    <li>To represent, compete, and maximise the success of the Club in competitions.</li>
                    <li>To act on behalf of and in the interests of Club Members.</li>
                    <li>To recognise the value of each member and treat all fairly while maintaining efficient use of the resources available.</li>
                    <li>To promote safe climbing and mountaineering practices by Club Members.</li>
                    <li>To promote awareness of Club Members of the need to maintain access, conservation and protection of the cliff and mountain environment.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>That this constitution and the code of conduct shall be published and made readily available to all members and committee members.					</li>
            <li>That the Constitution shall be reviewed formally at least once every 3 years at an Annual General Meeting (AGM) and a record of such review provided, and any amendments attached to the Constitution.</li>
            <li>This document first and foremost reflects the fundamental belief of the Club and its Members. We believe that climbing, mountaineering and CUMC ought to support all participants, in their personal endeavours, their academics, their social lives, and their well being both physical and mental. To do so we believe that respectful and open communication, a respect for the dignity, rights and worth of all participants as people,  and care for each other and our surroundings are essential. While we acknowledge the value of performance, we believe that it is possible, probable, and more sustainable if achieved within a framework which follows these guidelines, and competitive advantage shall never be seen as a justification to behave in an unacceptable manner. We believe that inclusivity of all sorts should be a central part of the Club and that we seek to create a welcoming environment that upholds that. We aim to act with good climbing etiquette, act fairly, always, and be positive role models for other members and other clubs. We aim to uphold an environment in which members and friends can safely and fairly challenge any behaviour which does not fall within this culture.</li>

                    <li>That the complainant and respondent both may bring a friend to support them at the discretion of the panel.
                        <ol>
                            <li>That the Conduct Committee should make all attempts to allow for this within reason, and should give justification for disallowing persons.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>That in line with university regulation the standard of proof used when making determinations under this procedure is on the balance of probabilities. This means that it is necessary to prove that it is more likely than not that a breach of the Club Regulations occurred before the Conduct Committee can impose any sanctions on the Respondent. Decisions must be supported by evidence; it is not enough to simply believe that something is likely to have happened. This requirement means that there may be some cases in which the Club decides that it is not appropriate to take or continue action under this procedure.</li>
                    <li>That the burden of proof that a breach of the Club Regulations has occurred rests with the Club. This means that it is for the Club to prove that there has been a breach of the Club Regulations, it is not for a Respondent to prove that a breach of the Club Regulations did not take place.</li>
                    <li>That any hearings panel must give a fair and independent hearing to the appellant within an appropriate timescale. Hearings must not contravene the Humans Rights Act 1998 or any other policies of the Club and/or the University and/or the BMC.</li>
                    <li>A unanimous vote of all three members of the Conduct Committee must be agreed upon for a Club temporary suspension to be enacted, with immediate effect.
                        <ol>
                            <li>An enacted temporary suspension means that the respondent will be barred from Club events, including, but not limited to: socials, meets, trips, training sessions, competitions while representing the Club, for the duration of 3 months from the date of the vote, or for the duration of any further investigation by an external body. </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>A Member called before the Conduct Committee may decide to waive their right to a hearing and voluntarily agree to a temporary suspension.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Should such a temporary suspension be enacted the following procedures apply:
                <ol>
                    <li>If the complainant or respondent should desire a resolution beyond the temporary suspension they are strongly encouraged to go to relevant University or other appropriate external authorities.
                        <ol>
                            <li>The Club and its members should not be seen as qualified or able to speak to the details of any complaint which fits the above description unless directly involved in complaints. </li>
                            <li>The Conduct Committee, in the case of a Member being found to have committed unsatisfactory conduct that is also in breach of the Club’s code of conduct by a panel raised by a College, the University, Police, or other authority, will hold a meeting wherein a vote regarding expulsion will occur. If in line with the finding of unsatisfactory conduct from the aforementioned panel, an expulsion will occur.. </li>
                            <li>That any finding of no unsatisfactory conduct from these authorities shall allow for the temporary suspension enacted by the Conduct Committee be lifted with immediate effect. </li>
                            <li>At the same time, any finding of no unsatisfactory conduct from these authorities shall not preclude the Club from taking action, but means that the Committee should not be compelled to take such action.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>This action cannot consist of expulsion but can consist of preventative measures decided by the President(s), Welfare Officer(s) and/or Senior Treasurer.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>While the Club should endeavour for confidentiality it cannot offer complete confidentiality. If any Member of the Club believes someone is at risk of harm by themselves or others, they must inform either the President(s), Senior Treasurer, the Welfare Team of the relevant College or other relevant external authority.</li>
            <li>That if the complaint presents a significant threat to the Club, an accusation of a breach of University regulations, or an accusation of a criminal offence the Club can refer the concern to the University authorities and minimise harm without punishing either complainant or respondent, and not prejudicing any potential proceedings.
                <ol>
                    <li>That the definition of these shall be determined on a case by case basis in consultation with the Conduct Committee.</li>
                    <li>The Club and its members should not be seen as qualified or able to speak to the details of any complaint which fits the above description unless directly involved in complaints. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>That any individual or member with a complaint about treatment by the Club should set out their grievance, first to the President(s), then to the Senior Treasurer, then to external bodies they see fit. The Club will seek to deal with complaints in a fair and timely manner, fully complying with all relevant bodies.</li>
