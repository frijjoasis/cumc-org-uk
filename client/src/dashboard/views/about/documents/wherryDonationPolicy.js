    <h2>Wherry Library Donations Policy</h2>,
    <p>The Wherry Library and Librarian are grateful to those who have made donations and who offer unsolicited material to the Library. Many of these items would not be obtainable otherwise and their acquisition enhances the usefulness of the collection. Really, thank you!</p>,
    <br />,
    <p>Traditionally, the Wherry Library has served as a reservoir of information for those who need practical know-how to help them get climbing, whether that takes the form of guidebooks for the crag or beginner's guides for the sport. At this point in the life of the C.U.M.C, the Wherry has also taken on historical significance as a collection of memoirs, journals and records from both the Club and the wider mountaineering world, many of which date well into the 19th century. The Library is interested in preserving this state of the collection, as both a store of mountaineering history and of practical advice for Club members, going forward. It is the hope of the Librarian that any parties kind enough to donate material to the Library consider how their donations might contribute to this goal.</p>,
    <br />,
    <p>The Wherry Librarian is delighted to be consulted regarding any prospective donations. Their email address can be found on the CUMC website.</p>,

    <h3>1 Donations</h3>,
    <p>Donations will be considered on their individual merit. The Club is glad to accept books, journals and similar material which make the Wherry Library a better store of historical information and practical guidance, as outlined above. The usefulness of potential acquisitions in this manner is decided at the discretion of the Wherry Librarian. The advice of the Club Committee and other experts may also be sought. The Library reserves the right to dispose of any donated material that is out of scope with this goal. All accepted donated items become the property of the Club.</p>,
    <br />,
    <p>If donating past Club journals, it would be greatly appreciated if a donor could provide a list of the volume numbers being offered so that they may be checked against the Library catalogue before acceptance. Potential donors are advised not to bring material to the Wherry Library for donation unless acceptance has been agreed.</p>,

    <h3>2 Conditions of Acceptance</h3>,
    <p>The Wherry must be selective in what donations it can accept, due in large part to the collection being housed in Cambridge University's Library Storage Facility (LSF) and the constraints that that imposes. Potential donors should be aware that the Wherry:</p>,
    <ul>
        <li>does not accept material in poor physical condition;</li>
        <li>cannot normally accept duplicate items; duplicates discovered after acceptance may replace existing items if they are in a superior condition, or may be disposed of;</li>
        <li>requires the donor to make arrangements beforehand in order to accept substantial donations, in regards to the transport of donations to Cambridge and their temporary storage during the time before they can be processed and transferred to the LSF;</li>
        <li>does not normally accept donations of photos or other ephemera; it would be great, however, if these were directed to the CUMC Records Archive at the University Library (email the Librarian anyway, and they can put you in touch);</li>
        <li>would prefer that donations be in print;</li>
        <li>will add any donated items to the Wherry's online catalogue on iDiscover; such items will be made requestable to all who can view them on a reference-only basis.</li>
    </ul>,

    <h3>3 Review of Policy</h3>,
    <p>The next review of this policy is expected to be in Michaelmas Term 2025, at the discretion of that year's Wherry Librarian.</p>,
    <p>Written 19/12/24</p>
