    <h1>CUMC Code of Conduct</h1>,<br></br>,
<ol>
<li>The Club is affiliated to the National Governing Body - the British Mountaineering Council (BMC). Further information can be found online at <a href="http://www.thebmc.co.uk">www.thebmc.co.uk</a>.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>Affiliation with the BMC provides the Club with worldwide liability insurance. However, for trips abroad, it is recommended that individuals purchase their own personal accident and travel insurance.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>The Club publishes a separate Safety Policy. However, underpinning all club activities is the BMC participation statement, namely: ‘The BMC recognises that climbing, hill walking and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death. Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions and involvement.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>The Club cannot offer any form of professional instruction; knowledge is disseminated from those more to those less experienced members in an informal manner under a voluntary capacity.. Consequently, any novice climbers must be aware that what they pick up from their peers may not adhere absolutely to current ‘best practice’ and does not constitute formal instruction. Please see the separate safety policy for further information.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>The Club is committed to maintaining and encouraging an environment of inclusivity wherever its activities take place. This includes indoor and outdoor meets, and virtual spaces such as the Whatsapp Chat Group and social media. We have a zero-tolerance policy on any behaviour that may threaten this, including but not limited to the use of offensive slurs, microaggressions, inappropriate jokes and/or comments of any sexually/ racially/ religiously/ gender discriminating nature. The committee strives to make climbing and mountaineering at the University of Cambridge an inclusive, accepting and accessible activity. Any instances of such behaviour should be communicated to a committee member, who will view the incident under the code of conduct.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>The Club moreover is strongly committed to a zero-tolerance sexual harrassment policy. Any sexually inappropriate behaviour (physical or verbal) should be communicated to a committee member. We are proud to uphold a safe environment where everyone can climb in their comfort zone. Climbers are encouraged to notify the committee if they feel uncomfortable with their assigned climbing partner (indoor or outdoor meets).
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>We are also committed to maintaining the physical safety of our members. Any intentional spread of misinformation and/or incorrect practice will be taken seriously as a breach of the club’s behavioural code of conduct. This includes, for example, factually incorrect jokes on how to use a belay device. Such information can be hazardous and lead to serious injury.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>The club also views lying about or exaggerating one’s experience and expertise as an infringement of the code of conduct. Such behaviour can lead to serious injury and even death. Members’ experience in lead belaying and trad leading should be recorded on the member’s database when signing up to meets. This can also include placing other climber’s safety in danger, for example, a belayer not allowing their climber to ‘take’ or not giving appropriate attention to belaying.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>Members also must take personal responsibility for the quality and state of the gear that they bring onto outdoor meets. This means ensuring their equipment has been rated, and regularly checking their items for signs of wear or damage. The Club can provide a limited range of equipment for use by its members. Whilst the Gear Secretary will endeavour to ensure that all gear lent out is in safe working order, the Club cannot ultimately be held responsible for any mishaps; all equipment must be checked by the user and the risks associated accepted.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>By extension, we also strongly encourage wearing helmets during outdoor meets and soloing is prohibited on club run meets.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>At competitions, members are representing themselves, the Club, and the University as a whole. As such, the zero-tolerance policy on behaviours mentioned above is extended to competitions and similar events. Furthermore, there is an expectation of good sportsmanship for any competing member. Inappropriate or unsporting behaviour should be communicated to a committee member.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>The club operates a 3 strike policy for members’ conduct. This can include both behavioural and safety related strikes. The committee reserves the right to skip the strike policy in cases of exceptional misconduct and members should be aware that being banned from the club is a potential sanction. Examples of strikes include but are not limited to: soloing on club meets, belaying without due care and attention, belittling of any members of the club, over exaggeration of climbing experience leading to unsafe practice. Any member is encouraged to contact a committee member if they would like to report any incident they feel is unsafe or unacceptable and their name will be kept anonymous by the committee.
<br></br><br></br></li>
<li>The committee strongly encourages members to have an appreciation for the ethics of climbing within the UK and abroad, and to also consider the requirement to ‘leave the crag as you found it’. This includes but is  not limited to disposal of any litter correctly, avoidance of excessive chalk use and ensuring it is brushed off before departing and general good etiquette like cleaning dirty climbing shoes before starting. Members should also observe any restrictions present on routes e.g. nesting birds and are encouraged to check the BMC RAD database for any local access issues prior to visiting the crag.
