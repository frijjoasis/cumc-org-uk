    <h1>CUMC COVID Guidelines</h1>,
<p>
This document will attempt to outline the changes to each aspect of club
activity due to COVID-19. All of the following is subject to change, as we as a
club have to respect the guidelines set by the BMC, University and Government
and other bodies, which are all being updated regularly. We will attempt to keep
this document as up to date as possible with the latest from us in terms of
planned activities and restrictions.
</p>,
<h2><strong>Outdoor Meets</strong></h2>,
<p>
Outdoor meets will currently be taking part this term unless there is any
significant change in the coming weeks.
</p>,
<p>
There will be a number of measures in place to make meets Covid safe and we will
be adhering to all the BMC guidelines given to student clubs.
</p>,
<p>
<strong>The measures that we will be adhering to on meets are:</strong>
</p>,
<ul>
    <li>Students must not attend meets if they have any symptoms of Covid-19</li>
    <li>Providing they are able to, students must be taking part in the University
    testing service to attend meets</li>
    <li>If they are able to take part in the above and providing it is running
    effectively, students must have a recent (circa 2 weeks) negative test in order
    to attend meets</li>
    <li>Students must not attend if anyone in their household is displaying symptoms</li>
    <li>Students must adhere to all college and government regulations in order to
    attend meets</li>
    <li>Food and drink sharing will <strong>not</strong> be permitted and students
    must bring sufficient food and water for themselves</li>
    <li>In line with government guidelines we are allowed to run meets up to a size
    of 30</li>
    <li>No overnight meets will be taking place this term and we will review this
    with the situation in January</li>
    <li>Contact tracing details of students will be taken for each meet by the
    organiser</li>
    <li>Students are advised to bring their own personal first aid kits if they have
    them</li>
    <li>A covid risk assessment form is to be completed for each meet based on the
    BMC template</li>
</ul>,
<p>
<strong>Regarding transport:</strong>
</p>,
<ul>
    <li>Masks are to be worn in the car at <strong>all times</strong> (except by
    those exempt)<strong> </strong>and students must use hand sanitizer upon
    entering and exiting the car</li>
    <li>Windows of the car are to be kept down by at least ⅓ for the duration of the
    journey and students are advised to travel in warm layers that you should have
    for the crag anyway</li>
    <li>Fuel stops are allowed and only the driver may enter the shop to pay, if
    necessary other students may visit the toilet</li>
    <li>No other stops are allowed on the journey</li>
</ul>,
<p>
<strong>Regarding climbing itself</strong>
</p>,
<ul>
<li>Students should maintain 2m social distancing at all times, with the
exception of when passing a belayer at the top of the route where students
should attempt to turn their faces away from each other when they pass</li>
<li>Use hand sanitiser between climbs</li>
<li>The venue will be carefully assessed by the outdoor meet secretaries in
advance of the meet to try and ensure that quiet and appropriate locations are
chosen</li>
<li>Unless it will compromise safety whilst leading a route students should not
be placing gear or rope in their mouths whilst climbing</li>
</ul>,
<p>
<strong>Indoor meets</strong>
</p>,
<ul>
    <li>General guidance: see outdoor meets for general CUMC meets policies</li>
    <li>Indoor meets will run weekly, day TBC (we are currently communicating with
    the gyms we usually visit to see what works best)</li>
    <li><strong>In the gym</strong>: All gyms will have their own policies so
    essentially we do what the gym tells us to do.</li>
    <li><strong>Numbers</strong>: Either 6 max or groups of 6. This will be based on
    what version of the rule of 6 gyms allow</li>
    <li><strong>How we’ll run things: </strong>Signup on the website as with all
    CUMC meets. We will organise the thing but it will just be a case of
    week-to-week organisation in keeping with guidance. We’re trying to keep things
    as flexible as possible so that we can run as much as possible rather than just
    blanket prohibiting anything. We’ll essentially allow what the government and
    BMC allow, so everything is <strong>subject to change</strong>, but we’ll keep
    you updated</li>
    <li><strong>Transport</strong>: We both have a car (the indoor secs), so between
    us we can take up to 6 people. However we won’t always be able to go and
    generally it might be that only one of us can attend. Therefore we would like
    participants to think about whether they would still want to attend if they were
    required to take public transport (this should be included as an option on the
    signup form), since there are gyms accessible by train from Cambridge and if we
    can’t find a driver this will be our best option.</li>
</ul>,
<h2><strong>Competitions</strong></h2>,
<p>
<strong>There has been no information to suggest that any of our major
competitions will be cancelled.</strong> However, with the IFSC cancelling World
Cups for the rest of the year, there is a chance that Michaelmas Term
competitions (i.e. the first LUBE) will be cancelled.
</p>,
<p>
<strong>Transport </strong>can be discussed with competitors who choose to
attend closer to the time based on safety and government regulations, but will
likely involve trains and not car sharing.
</p>,
<p>
<strong>BUCS</strong>: Currently scheduled to go ahead (Lent Term).
</p>,
<p>
<strong>LUBE</strong>: To go ahead, with some changes. Teams will have a 2-3
week window to go down and try the competition blocks once. 4 qualification
rounds as usual, and hopefully a final at the end of the year. Scored on
attempts, as usual, to keep things fair for us and other non-London unis.
</p>,
<p>
<strong>Varsity</strong>: Usually in Lent Term, so hopefully/likely to go ahead.
Oxford to organise this year?
</p>,
<p>
<strong>Cuppers</strong>: To go ahead, provided RR is allowed to stay open under
government guidance. All scoring can be done digitally (no printed sheets to be
provided). People can partake in their own time at safe distances from other
climbers. If a second lockdown occurs, there is a possibility of another virtual
Cuppers.
</p>,
<p>
<strong>Training</strong>: I am currently re-writing the training regime. Old
plans focused on group workouts in the relatively small upstairs training room
at RR. New plans will be more climbing specific and allow spacing around the
centre. Digital notes will be provided so that people who wish to avoid larger
CUMC groups can undertake a weekly training session in their own time.
</p>,
<p>
I (Hugo) am currently shielding and would prefer not to return to main CUMC
sessions for at least a while. If anyone else on the committee wants to run
training sessions for those who don’t mind attending at popular times, please
get in contact with me!
</p>,
<h2><strong>Socials</strong></h2>,
<p>
<strong>Weekly Socials:</strong>
</p>,
<ul>
    <li>Socials will be happening on Thursday afternoons, as Rainbow Rocket has
    introduced stricter policies on customer numbers</li>
    <li>After-climbing socials will be outdoors in gro</li>ups of up to 6. Earlier than
    usual (afternoon/early evening) to avoid any issues with curfews
    <li>There is the possibility of moving to pubs later in term if it’s reasonable
    to do so (depending on household mixing laws)</li>
</ul>,
<p>
<strong>Other</strong>
</p>,
<ul>
    <li>Online socials may occur, subject to demand - outdoor socials will almost
    certainly prove to be more popular than online</li>
    <li>Small swaps (Gardies are allowing swaps of 2 groups of 6) would depend on
    household mixing laws, and the situation with COVID. This will be reviewed later
    in term.</li>
    <li>If the guidance changes back to allowed groups of 30+ (or thereabouts), we
    could do outdoor socials in larger groups. This will remain under review.</li>
</ul>,
