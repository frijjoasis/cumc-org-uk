    <b>
        Aims
    </b>,
    <p>
        CUMC regards the health, safety and welfare of all members to be of paramount importance. The fundamental basis for our welfare policy is the desire to treat our athletes’ responsibly and with respect and to support them in their pursuit of both their academic and sporting goals. The Club recognises that welfare is not just about safety on the pitch but covers the full breadth of Club activities from training and competition through to socials and our media presence.

        To this end, the CUMC aims to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that policies, procedures and practices are in place to maintain a safe and healthy environment and promote a positive club culture, not only for its members but also for other people and organisations that may be affected by the activities of the Club.

        The current Welfare Officer is Keying Guo, who can be contacted at welfare@cumc.org.uk.
    </p>,
    <p>
        The role of the Club Welfare Officer is to promote welfare centred practices within the club environment, provide a confidential, initial contact point for members in relation to welfare concerns and signpost individuals to relevant University, College and Community support systems when required. The role holder will:-
    </p>,

        <li>Be a confidential point of contact for any issues concerning welfare within the Sports Club environment, e.g. poor practice, selection policy concerns, training/competition pressures from captains, coaches or other members, potential/alleged bullying or harassment.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all incidents are reported correctly and referred, in accordance with the Club Welfare Policy and, where appropriate, Disciplinary Policy.</li>
        <li>Keep up to date with referral routes available to students within the University, College and local area and signpost members accordingly.</li>

    </ul>,
	<p>
	Please note that it is NOT the role of the Club Welfare Officers to provide individual counselling support to club members. The Colleges work in close partnership with the University to provide the very best pastoral and welfare support to students and, as part of that partnership, individuals such as College Tutors and Senior Tutors have formal welfare roles and responsibilities and, as such, are better placed to provide guidance and support to students on non-sport specific welfare matters. 
	</p>,
	<p>
	The University Counselling Service can provide individual counselling support for students in a range of areas, including anxiety, depression, academic related issues and relationships. In addition, Mental Health Advisors, working in the Counselling Service, can provide support and guidance to students who are in crisis or who are experiencing moderate to severe mental health difficulties. There are also a range of self-help guides, resources and information for students available on the University Counselling Service website at: https://www.counselling.cam.ac.uk/
