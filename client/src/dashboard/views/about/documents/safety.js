    <h3>1 Introduction</h3>,
    <p>This policy is designed to outline the various safety issues that have been considered by the club and how they affect its running.
        <br /><br />
        Certain positions within the club committee have a designated responsibility for safety. The President will take the lead in promoting a positive safety culture within the club and is ultimately responsible for this. The Outdoor, Indoor and Alpine and Winter secretaries are responsible for leading and promoting the safe practice in their respective disciplines. There will also be a safety secretary role that is to be designated to the gear secretary or one of the outdoor meet secretaries at the AGM each year, depending on who feels the most informed. This person will be responsible for reviewing this document continuously.
        <br /><br />
        The committee, as well as club members, should ensure that those holding such positions have the appropriate knowledge and experience to fulfil effectively their health and safety responsibilities. In taking up the position of a club officer, an individual must understand that they are accepting responsibility and they must fulfil those duties to the best of their ability without negligence.
    </p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>2 Safety on meets</h3>,
    <p>
        <b>
            No member is responsible for any other member regardless of experience; each member is responsible for their own actions and decisions whilst climbing. This is a direct reflection of the BMC participation statement: ‘The BMC recognises that climbing, hill walking and mountaineering are activities with a danger of personal injury or death. Participants in these activities should be aware of and accept these risks and be responsible for their own actions and involvement.’
        </b>
    <br /><br />
    New members are to be made explicitly clear that this is the case and there should be an open discussion of the risks involved before they attend meets to ensure that they have a good understanding of the risks involved, but ultimately, they are always their own responsibility.
    Any members lacking items of equipment should contact the gear secretary. Members with questions concerning the nature of the climbing should contact the meet organiser, usually the indoor or outdoor meet secretary.
    <br /><br />
    Members without climbing experience are encouraged to gain the necessary skills as they see fit. No member shall be considered as an instructor unless they have the required qualifications and are acting in an official capacity on the trip, in which case they must ensure they have their own insurance.
    <br /><br />
    The meet organiser will endeavour to ensure that there is always an appropriate mix of experienced and inexperienced climbers on a meet. However, it must be appreciated that this may not always be possible; the first paragraph of this section must be borne in mind. Please refer to the lower section on novices climbing for guidance on novices attending meets.
    <br /><br />
    The meet organiser will be one of the indoor/outdoor meet secretaries, if they are not in attendance of the meet there is to be a nominated leader for each trip who is to have a role in considering safety whilst on the meet.
    <br /><br />
    Members on a trip should be given the phone number of the trip leader (the Outdoor/Indoor Meet Secretary unless otherwise specified) and a Cambridge contact for use in an emergency or if a problem/delay arises.
    <br /><br />
    It is the responsibility of the individual to inspect any equipment borrowed from the club and to ensure they have adequate knowledge regarding its proper usage. Any problems or issues should be reported immediately to the Gear Secretary (if present) or the trip leader.
    <br /><br />
    The Club endorses fully the use of helmets for all outdoor climbing activities; they are available to borrow from the Gear Secretary.
    <br /><br />
    A suitable number of first aid kits must be taken on all trips; ‘suitable’ equates to a minimum of one per group for single-pitch cragging outings.  Group shelters should also be taken on all meets if possible, even to accessible crags as they are very useful for keeping the group warm in the event of an accident.
    <br /><br />
    Route cards for days involving trips to less accessible locations/walking trips if the weather is poor must be filled in with a route plan, expected return time. These do not need to be done for a trip to Stanage for example when easy contact with all members of the group can be facilitated. Examples of where these must also be filled in each day include the CIC hut trip, weekend meets and the annual meet in the summer.
</p>,

    <br />,
<h3>2.1 Driving on meets</h3>,

<p>
    <b>
        Drivers use cars at their own risk, whether they own the car or have hired it. They are responsible for ensuring that they are correctly licensed, taxed, insured and that their car is road legal.
    </b>
    <br /><br />
    If a driver is feeling fatigued or drowsy while driving then they should take a break at the first available safe opportunity. Passengers should not pressure the driver into avoiding stops in order to get to the location sooner.
    <br /><br />
    Drivers will be reimbursed at a rate of 25p per mile driven. This is intended to cover fuel and wear & tear only i.e. not insurance, depreciation, tax etc. If a car is hired then the driver will simply be reimbursed for the cost of hire and fuel (receipts must be retained as proof of purchase). Those hiring for the club should first read the guide to hiring on the club website.
</p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>3 Insurance</h3>,

<p>The Cambridge University mountaineering club is an affiliated club of the British Mountaineering Council (BMC). The BMC provides club liability insurance cover for the club and its members. The cover is applicable worldwide, subject to the exclusion of any legal action brought against the insured in a court of law within the USA/Canada. This does not mean that activities in the USA/Canada are excluded, only that legal actions brought in the USA/Canada are excluded. It is recommended that members take out their own personal accident and travel insurance for trips that take place abroad.
    New members of the club have a 3 month grace period for the BMC insurance cover from the start of the year however after that they must have purchased membership in order to attend any club meets and be covered by our BMC insurance. Note that the BMC cover does not cover personal accidents and if members would like this cover it can be upgraded for £15 per year by contacting the secretary.
</p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>4 Novices in the club</h3>,

<p>A note on teaching members. The club is insured by the BMC and this includes cover for teaching on an informal basis. However, the leader must be competent to be able to teach someone else (at the discretion of the committee) and the novice must be made aware of the basis on which the teaching is taking place, i.e. that it is NOT formal instruction and that leaders are volunteering to share their skills, and it is merely a guide based on the knowledge of the members of the club.
</p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>4.1 Teaching belaying</h3>,

<p>Novices are able to follow the flow diagram below as a means to become competent in lead belaying and be able to attend an outdoor meet.
    <br /><br />
    Summarised here as:
    <br /><br />
    Novices must first attend one of the committee run rope skills workshops held on Jesus Green which will be held towards the start of term. After that they must then attend 2 indoor meets where they practice lead belaying, the first of these should involve some help from a competent club member who can tail to the rope and allow the novice to practice catching a lead fall before they are allowed to belay independently. The following club meet must be with a club member who is happy to keep an eye on their belaying throughout the session and report any concerns back to a committee member.
    <br /><br />
    Providing no concerns have been raised during this process, the member will then be allowed to belay on indoor meets providing they are paired with a competent member. On the first outdoor meet a member attends, a competent club member will be assigned by the outdoor meets secretaries to go over some of the aspects of outdoor belaying that are slightly different to indoors (e.g. using twin lines), and will be assigned to check up on them during the meet. Once the committee is satisfied with an individual's progress and competency belaying (assessed on a case by case basis), they will be able to belay on all indoor and outdoor meets without being paired with a competent member.
    <br /><br />
    A list of club members considered to meet this description of competence can be found under the club documents folder and it is to be updated yearly by the current committee.
</p>,
    <br />,

    <img
        src={require('./learn2belay.png').default}
        alt="Learn to Belay"
    />
    </div>,
<h3>4.2 Indoor meets</h3>,

<p>Novices must attend a belaying skills session prior to attending an indoor meet. Please see above for the pathway that novices can follow.
    <br /><br />
    Some of the ground based exercises that can be used on the initial indoor meet include: using a pulley on the first or second clip with one person feeding out the rope and the novice taking in, the person feeding then sits down into the rope meaning the novice has to ‘catch’ the fall and can understand what this process feels like. Other options include having the novice belay someone that is backed-up by another belayer on top rope.
    <br /><br />
    A lead fall must then be caught with a competent member tailing the rope after the above exercises have been performed.
</p>,

    <br />,
    <h3>4.3 Outdoor meets</h3>,

<p>All people attending outdoor meets must be able to lead belay. If this is not the case then members should refer to the pathway above in gaining competency in lead belaying. The only exception to this scenario is freshers meet at the start of the year where there will be a suitable number of experienced climbers such that novices will not be required to belay.
</p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>5 Risk assessments</h3>,

<p>It is a requirement of the University to have an up to date risk assessment for club activities. It is a condition of funding from the Societies Syndicate that the safety procedures of such clubs (that do hazardous activities) are approved by the Director of Physical Education.
    <br /><br />
    Risk assessments have been done to cover the following club activities: (a) indoor climbing/bouldering, (b) outdoor climbing/bouldering and (c) hill walking. These risk assessments should be reviewed on an annual basis. If any individual should wish to inspect them, please contact the Secretary.
    <br /><br />
    Club risk assessments are also to be updated each year and these are to be done by the safety officer which is to be designated to the gear sec or one of the outdoor meet secs each year at the AGM. These are to be based on the BMC templates for clubs and will be available to view on the website under the documents section.
</p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>6 Equipment</h3>,

    <p>
        The Gear Secretary is responsible for the lending of club equipment to members. They will follow the British Mountaineering Council recommendations for care and maintenance of club kit.
    </p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>6.1 Equipment lending</h3>,
    <p>
        <b>
            The club and the Gear Secretary shall endeavour to keep the club gear in good condition, however those borrowing
            the gear must understand that we are ultimately a student society with limited resources. The borrower must
            make their own assessment of the condition of any gear they borrow before using it.
        </b>
    </p>,
    <p>
        On loaning the Gear Secretary shall record the items lent to any individual, and the date on which they were
        lent.
    </p>,
    <p>
        A precondition for borrowing is the acceptance of the club’s financial policy regarding lost or stolen
        equipment (see Section 6.3).
    </p>,
    <p>
        On return the secretary is responsible for ascertaining:
    </p>,
    <ul>
        <li>
            If any major falls have been taken. If so, all relevant gear should be checked for damage. This entails
            checking whether (a) nuts, hexes and cams are severely misshapen or have damaged wires, and (b) whether
            there are cuts or regions of serious abrasion on soft gear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any equipment showing these signs should be immediately retired.
        </li>
        <li>
            Any helmets that have endured a major impact should also be retired.
        </li>
        <li>
            A rope that has held a major fall should be checked along its full length for any major unevenness, again
            which if present means the rope should be retired.
        </li>
        <li>
            A rope with minor damage (such as small amounts of sheath separation or furring up of the surface) should
            be downgraded to a top-rope as below.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the gear has been near seawater, i.e. used at a sea-cliff, it should all be washed and re-lubricated as
            necessary. If any of the gear has corrosion which cannot easily be removed it should be retired.
        </li>
    </ul>,
    <br />,
        <h3>6.2 Equipment maintenance</h3>,
    <p>
        A record of the purchase details (including date) and safety checks of club safety gear should be kept.
    </p>,
    <p>
        The Gear sec should inspect the general condition of gear when it is returned (in accordance with point 3 in
        section 6.1).
    </p>,
    <p>
        At handover the new Gear sec should inspect all gear and flag anything they think needs replacing or retiring.
        If unsure they should consult other members of the committee.
    </p>,
    <p>
        No rope should be used for lead climbing for more than six years. After this, the rope may still be used for
        top-roping or as a safety rope if it is in reasonable condition.
    </p>,
    <p>
        All other gear can be used indefinitely, as long as it is deemed to be in reasonable condition.
    </p>,
    <br />,
        <h3>6.3 Lost and stolen policy</h3>,

    <p>
        The club shall attempt to recoup money from those who lose or steal club equipment. Losing gear includes
        getting trad gear stuck, or any situation where the borrower did not take reasonable steps to look after the
        gear. If in doubt, ask the question “if this person borrowed my personal gear and lost/damaged it in this way,
        would I expect them to offer to replace it?”. If the answer to that is yes, then the club should try to recoup
        money. The value of equipment is to be estimated according to the following:
    </p>,
    <p>
        For any metal gear:
    </p>,
    <p className="text-center">
        <code>value = cost when purchased</code>
    </p>,
    <p>
        For any soft gear:
    </p>,
    <p className="text-center">
        <code>value = cost * (1 - age/recommended maximum age)</code>
    </p>,
    <p>
        This is a guideline only; it may be that the equipment has no ‘recommended maximum age’, or that other
        unprecedented circumstances render the above inappropriate. In such cases, the Gear Secretary should consult
        the President for further advice.
    </p>,
    <br />,
    <h3>7 Accident procedures</h3>,

<p>In the first instance, club members should ensure their own safety. In the event of an accident, the emergency services should be called where necessary and the university informed. Mountain rescue can be contacted by dialling 999, asking for the police and then asking for mountain rescue. All incidents and accidents must be reported by submitting an accident report form to the Physical Education Department. The emergency contacts of any person involved in a serious accident should be contacted at the earliest possible opportunity.
    <br />
    In the event of an accident/incident, there is to be no discussion of the incident on social media. There is to be no discussion on any other forums e.g UKC except by committee members if appropriate and discussed as a club.
</p>,
    <br />,
<h3>8 Changes to the policy</h3>,

<p>This document should be kept up to date and is to be reviewed by the safety secretary each year. A revised version can be approved by a simple majority of votes from the committee.
